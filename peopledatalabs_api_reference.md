# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/data-license

We provide many of our customers bulk person datasets in the form of an annual license. Some customers license our entire dataset while others license custom subsets of the data. To learn more, [speak with one of our Data Consultants](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/talk-to-sales).

## The value of a License

### 1. You have the data on premise.

During the license period, the customer has the right to use the data in any way as long as it is compliant with our [Acceptable Data Use Policy](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/acceptable-data-use-policy).

### 2. Unparalleled data coverage

Read more about our [coverage](/docs/datasets) here.

### 3. You get access to our customer success team

We provide all our volume API and license customers dedicated [engineering support](/docs/customer-support), including a shared Slack channel and a support email. Working with large datasets is hard. Our customer success team helps ensure that you get a ROI from the data as quickly as possible.

### 4. Unlimited access

Often search and matching APIs become prohibitively expensive at large volumes, but we hope to disrupt this market by providing the same or better data at a significantly lower price for larger engineering products.

### 5. Flexible licensing parameters

We allow customers to slice and dice the data in order to ensure that they only receive (and spend money on) the profiles that they need.

### Tailored Delivery Solutions

We offer a variety of options for how to [receive data licenses](/docs/receiving-and-updating-data) including deliveries through S3, GCP, Azure and more. Additionally, we also offer [Delta Files](/docs/delta-file-deliveries) consisting of just the subset of modified records from each build to streamline your data ingestion workflows.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/delta-file-deliveries

# What is a Delta File?

Delta Files are a new delivery format for data licenses that contains just the changes between the current delivery and the previous one (i.e. the “delta” between the two updates). Delta Files are designed to be significantly smaller both in terms of file size and number of records, with the goal of being simpler, faster and easier for users to ingest into their data pipeline.

Delta File Deliveries are organized into 5 subfolders containing records that have changed between the previous delivery and the current one. The subfolders are:

1. Merged IDs
2. Added Records
3. Updated Records
4. Opted Out IDs
5. Deleted IDs

> ⚠️
>
> ### Limitations
>
> Delta Files are currently **only available for Person Data Licenses** and are **not yet available for delivery through Snowflake**.

## How does it work?

Delta Files are custom generated for each customer based on their current data license slice and delivery cadences. When building the data delivery for each customer, we compare the most recent build of our data against the last delivered set of data received by the customer.

We then extract just the subset of records that have changed and group them into the 5 directories listed above, which is delivered as a Delta File delivery. Delta files are delivered using the existing set delivery channels available to data license customers.

During the initial onboarding period, customers will receive both the full data license as well as the delta file delivery in order to support transitioning to the new delivery format.

> ⚠️
>
> ### Important Reminders
>
> There are a couple important requirements when using Delta Files to update your dataset:
>
> * You must be up-to-date with your last full license delivery before switching over to Delta Files (meaning you have completed ingesting it). This is to ensure that you do not retain any out-of-date records in your pipeline.
> * If you decide to change the data slice that you are licensing from PDL (i.e. any change to the underlying query), you will need to first re-ingest an initial full license delivery before switching back to Delta Files.

## How to get access

Delta Files are available as an add-on for Data License Customers.

As of our May 2024 (v26.1) release, this offering is currently in an open beta available for customers to evaluate the new format and share any additional feedback.

At this time, the delta file format is not supported on Snowflake and only supported for Person data licenses, with potential to provide similar delta files for our Snowflake customers and company data in the future.

To sign up for beta access to the Delta Files, please reach out to your Customer Success team

## Overview

This Quickstart is a brief introduction to our data and APIs.

Don’t worry if you’ve never used an API before, as with a little copy-and-paste magic we’ll get you up and running quickly.

In just a few minutes, you will be retrieving and accessing real person and company data directly from our datasets.

Here’s what we’ll cover:

1. Creating an account
2. Sending your first Person Enrichment API request
3. Sending your first Company Enrichment API request

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/create-an-account

To access our data, you will need an API key.

You can get one by creating a free account at [www.peopledatalabs.com/signup](http://www.peopledatalabs.com/signup), clicking **API Keys**, and copying the **Active Key**.

> 🚧
>
> ### Warning!
>
> This is your ***secret*** API key, so please keep it private. We charge you credits based on usage associated with it. If for some reason you need a new API key, you can always generate one from the dashboard.

## Overview

The Person Enrichment API allows you to get additional information about an individual using data you already have like name, email, LinkedIn URL, and more. Once you have your API key, you can look up a person profile from our Person Dataset using the [Person Enrichment API](/docs/enrichment-api).

## Sending your first request

💡 **Did you know you can send an API request in the same way you navigate to a webpage?**

Copy the following URL and paste it into a new tab in your browser.

> ❗️
>
> ### Before pasting the URL
>
> * Replace `XXXX` after `api_key` with your API key
> * This will **consume 1 API credit** of your free 100 monthly credits for the Person Enrichment API. To read more about credits, check out this [Help Center article](https://support.peopledatalabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/23553812020891-Pricing-Overview)

URL

```
https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich?api_key=XXXX&pretty=True&profile=linkedin.com/in/seanthorne
```

The result should look something like this:

> 📘
>
> ### Pro tip
>
> If you want a better way to work with the result in a browser, consider downloading a [JSON Formatting extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?pli=1)

**Here's what just happened:**

1. You sent an API request to the Person Enrichment API for the profile associated with the following LinkedIn account: `linkedin.com/in/seanthorne`
2. The Person Enrichment API finds the best matching profile record in our [Person Dataset](/docs/datasets)
3. The API returns a JSON-formatted [profile record](/docs/example-record) in response with a `200` status, which indicates that a record was successfully found
4. The result of the above URL should be the profile for Sean Thorne (the co-founder of People Data Labs) from our [Person Dataset](/docs/datasets)

**A couple key points to note on profiles in our datasets:**

* Every profile record in our datasets is returned as a [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) object
* Profiles in our Person Dataset will contain information relating to hundreds of fields in our [Person Schema](/docs/fields), which can enable a wide range of different use cases

### Try Looking Up Your Own Person Profile

You can also look up someone besides our venerable co-founder. Copy the profile URL of your favorite person on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) (which could even be yourself). Use it to run the following command:

> ❗️
>
> ### Before pasting the URL
>
> * Replace `XXXX` after `api_key` with your API key
> * Replace `YYYY` after `profile` with the LinkedIn URL that you want to “enrich”
> * This will **consume 1 API credit** of your free 100 monthly credits for the Person Enrichment API. To read more about credits, check out this [Help Center article](https://support.peopledatalabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/23553812020891-Pricing-Overview)

URL

```
https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich?api_key=XXXX&pretty=True&profile=YYYY
```

This time you should see one of 2 results:

1. A profile from our Person Dataset containing all the information that we have associated with that LinkedIn URL (similar to what we got before.)
2. An status code of 404 indicating that the profile could not be found in our dataset. If this happens, try picking a different LinkedIn profile to enrich.

In the above example, you're simply looking up profiles by their LinkedIn URL, but the Person Enrichment API supports lookups using a [variety of different inputs](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api), such as name, email, phone numbers, employer, locations and more. Feel free to dive deeper into the [Person Enrichment API](/docs/enrichment-api), but at this point you should have a basic understanding of the type of information contained within our Person Dataset.

## Social Presence

We currently cover person social profiles on our [Canonical Profile Networks](/docs/profile-networks). All profiles we've found for a person will be added to the [`profiles`](#profiles) list.

Each social profile URL has one or more standard formats that we parse and turn into a standard PDL format for that social URL. We invalidate profiles that have non-valid person stubs (for example, `linkedin.com/company`), and we also have a blacklist of usernames that we know are invalid.

We do not validate if a URL is valid (that is, whether you can access it) because doing this at scale is considered a Direct Denial of Service (DDoS) attack and/or a form of crawling. This is highly discouraged! We try to mitigate invalid URLs as much as possible by using Entity Resolution (Merging) to link URLs together and then tagging the primary URL at the top level for key networks.

| Description | The most relevant industry for this person based on their work history. |
| Data Type | `Enum (String)` |

#### Field Details

A person's industry is determined based on their tagged personal industries and the industries of the companies that they have worked for.

The value will be one of our [Canonical Industries](/docs/industries).

#### Example

JSON

```
"industry": "computer software"
```

### `inferred_years_experience`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The person's inferred years of total work experience. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The person's self-reported interests. |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

Each interest is cleaned (lowercased, stripped of whitespace, etc.). We don't have a canonical list of interests but we remove profanity and do some basic cleaning.

> 💡
>
> ### Sort Order
>
> Interests are sorted alphabetically (from A→Z)

#### Example

JSON

```
"interests": [
    "data",
    "software"
  ]
```

### `job_history`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Additional professional positions that may have been removed or changed on resumes. |
| Data Type | `Array [Object]` |

#### Field Details

Any additional job history information PDL has that is not included in the [`experience`](#experience) field.

Usually these are positions that have been removed or changed on resumes.

| Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `company_id` | `String` | [PDL Company ID](/docs/company-schema#id) |
| `company_name` | `String` | [Company Name](/docs/company-schema#name) |

  ]
```

### `skills`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The person's self-reported skills. |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

Each skill is cleaned (lowercased, stripped of whitespace, etc.). We do not always strip punctuation because it can be relevant for some skills (ex: `"c++"` vs `"c"`).

We do not do any canonicalization, so `"java"` and `"java 8.0"` are considered separate skills. For this reason, we encourage our customers to use fuzzy text matching with the `skills` field.

> 💡
>
> ### Sort Order
>
> Skills are sorted alphabetically (from A→Z)

#### Example

JSON

```
"skills": [
    "entrepreneurship"
  ]
```

| --- | --- |
| Description | User-inputted personal summary. |
| Data Type | `String` |

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/person-enrichment-api

## Overview

The Person Enrichment API enables you to enrich data on a person by performing a one-to-one match of this person with the nearly three billion individual profiles that are hosted in our dataset.

### `data_include`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | A comma-separated string of fields that you want the response to include. |  | `"full_name,emails.address"` |

If this input parameter is not included, the full [person profile](/docs/fields) will be returned.

Include multiple fields by separating each with a comma. Include specific subfields by using dot notation (ex: `emails.address`).

Exclude field(s) by using `-` as the first character. Entering `-` will exclude all of the comma-separated fields following the character and needs to be entered only once. For example, `"-education,mobile_phone"` will remove the `education` and `mobile_phone fields` from the enriched profile response.

To exclude all data from being returned, use `data_include=""`.

### `pretty`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | Whether the output should have [human-readable](http://jsonprettyprint.net/) indentation. | `false` | `true` |

### `min_likelihood`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The minimum likelihood score that a response must have in order to count as a match. | `2` | `6` |

This parameter allows you to balance precision and recall. In other words, using a high `min_likelihood` value will only return very strong matches but at the risk of not returning any match at all if none can be found above the `min_likelihood` threshold. Alternatively, using a low `min_likelihood` value is more likely to give you a match but at the cost of returning a potentially weaker match.

By default, match recall is kept very high, so a response that returns a likelihood score of `2` will have roughly a 10-30% chance of being the person requested. Adding more data points to your requests will increase the probability of a successful match (high likelihood score and is actually the requested person).

Some general rules of thumb for setting this parameter:

* For use cases which rely on a high degree of data accuracy, use a value of ≥ `6`.
* Requests made with only a few less-specific data points will return lower scores.
* Requests made with only a few data points (for example, a name and a location), will rarely return a likelihood score > `4`.
* Requests made with just a name return a score between `2` and `5`, based on the quality of the match.
* Requests made with just an email will rarely return a likelihood score > `6`.

### `include_if_matched`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | If `true`, the response will include the top-level field [`matched`](/docs/output-response-person-enrichment-api) that contains a list of every query input that matched this profile. | `false` | `true` |

As an example, if we wanted to enrich Sean Thorne using the following query:

JSON

```
{
   "first_name": "sean",
   "last_name": "thorne",
   "company": "people data labs",
   "location": "abu dhabi",
   "include_if_matched": true
}
```

Since Sean's location is in California and not Abu Dhabi in the dataset, the response would contain:

JSON

```
{
   "matched": [
        "company",
        "name"
    ]
}
```

### `required`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The fields a response must have in order to count as a match. |  | `education AND (emails OR phone_numbers)` |

This parameter ensures that we only charge you for responses that include the data fields that you're interested in. You can use any top-level [fields](/docs/fields) as required parameters, except those that you use as search parameters, input fields, and fields that are not included in API responses based on your API key. If you include a field in both the request and the `required` parameter, the `required` parameter will not work.

Format the value as a boolean statement.

**Examples**

*The response must contain a Linkedin URL*:

cURL

```
required=linkedin_url
```

*The response must contain experience and a current work email*:

cURL

```
required=experience AND work_email
```

*The response must contain experience or emails*:

cURL

```
required=experience OR emails
```

*The response must contain education and either emails or phone\_numbers*:

cURL

```
required=education AND (emails OR phone_numbers)
```

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/reference-person-enrichment-api

The Person Enrichment API provides a **one-to-one** person match, retrieving up-to-date information on a unique individual.

# Endpoint

The endpoint for the Person Enrichment API is `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich`.

# Person Enrichment API Access and Billing

You can access the Person Enrichment API through our [self-signup dashboard](https://peopledatalabs.com/signup/)

When the API finds a matching person, it returns this person along with an HTTP response code of `200`. When it doesn't find a matching person, it returns an HTTP response code of `404`. We charge **per match**.

# Requests

See [Authentication](/docs/authentication) and [Requests](/docs/requests) sections to see all possible ways to input a request. We recommend using a JSON object to capture input parameters and will do so in the examples.

# Rate Limiting

Our default limit for free customers is 100 per minute. Our default limit for paying customers is 1,000 per minute.

**Note**: To allow for more enrichments without putting too much strain on our system, you can use the [Bulk Person Enrichment API](/docs/bulk-person-enrichment-api) to increase the number of enrichments per request, effectively increasing your rate limit by up to a hundred times.

# Input Parameters

When querying the API in URL, you can add data points to a queried person as key/value pairs at the end of a `v5` request string.

You can use the following parameters to specify information on a requested person. Adding more data points to a request increases the probability of a `200` response and will further increase the accuracy of the response's [Likelihood Score](/docs/output-response-person-enrichment-api#likelihood).

All query parameters listed below are optional.

> 📘
>
> ### For more details, see [Input Parameters - Person Enrichment API](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api)

## Additional Input Parameters

You are not required to use the following additional input parameters. They generally transform or control various aspects of the enrichment process (returning matches or formatting results.)

| Parameter Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |

| [`required`](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api#required) | The fields and data points that a response must have to return a `200` status code. | `"education AND (emails OR phone_numbers)"` |
| [`data_include`](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api#data_include) | A comma-separated string of the fields that you want the response to include.  Begin the string with a `-` if you want to *exclude* the specified fields. If you want to exclude all data from being returned, use `data_include=""`. | `"full_name,emails.address"` |

## Minimum Inputs

The minimum combination of data points that a request must contain in order to return a `200` response are:

cURL

```
profile OR email OR phone OR email_hash OR lid OR ( 
    (
        (first_name AND last_name) OR name) AND 
        (locality OR region OR company OR school OR location OR postal_code)
    )
```

# Output Response

When you execute an API request, we preprocess the queried data points and build them into a query, which we then execute against our [API dataset](/docs/datasets#api-dataset). If the query yields one or more matching persons from the dataset, we return in the API response the person who is most likely the person requested, along with a `200` HTTP response code. If we do not find a match, we return a `404` HTTP response code.

## Response Fields

> 📘
>
> ### For more details, see [Output Response - Person Enrichment API](/docs/output-response-person-enrichment-api)
>
> You can also click the field names in the table below to view more information on them.

| Field | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`data`](/docs/output-response-person-enrichment-api#data) | A matched profile record that contains fields from our [Person Schema](/docs/fields). Any fields in the profile record that do not contain any data will have a `null` value. | `Object` |
| [`status`](/docs/output-response-person-enrichment-api#status) | The response code. See a description of our [error codes](errors). | `Integer` |
| [`likelihood`](/docs/output-response-person-enrichment-api#likelihood) | The degree of confidence. The field is an integer between `1` and `10` and represents how confident we are that the person we returned is the same as the person you requested. You can control the minimum likelihood score a response must have in order to return a `200` by using the [`min_likelihood`](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api#min_likelihood) parameter in the API request. | `Integer` |

## Response Data Structure

Here is an example response from the Person Enrichment API:

JSON

```
{
    "status": 200,
    "likelihood": 10,
    "data":  {
            "id": "qEnOZ5Oh0poWnQ1luFBfVw_0000",
            "full_name": "sean thorne",
            ...
     }
}
```

See [Example Person Record](/docs/example-record) for a full example of the fields included in the `data` object.

## Errors

If the request encounters an error, it will instead return an Error Response in the format described in [Errors](/docs/errors).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/preview-enrichment-api

## Overview

The Preview Enrichment API supports our [Person Enrichment API](/docs/person-enrichment-api) by providing a preview of what fields have data in a record.

We’ve heard from many of our users in the lead/candidate search platform market that they often “tease” their users with previews of contact information for a person to incentivize them. The Preview Enrichment API will help solve this problem.

## Request Format

The endpoint for the Preview Enrichment API is `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich/preview`.

See [Input Parameters - Person Enrichment API](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api) for details on the supported parameters. All valid input parameters for the Person Enrichment API will work the same way for the Preview Enrichment API.

### Example

Python3cURL

```
import requests, json

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY"

# Set the Preview Enrichment API URL
PDL_URL = "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich/preview"

# Set the headers
HEADERS = {
    "X-Api-Key": API_KEY
}

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
    "email": ["sean@peopledatalabs.com"],
    "min_likelihood": 6
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
json_response = requests.get(PDL_URL, headers=HEADERS, params=PARAMS).json()

# Check for successful response
if json_response["status"] == 200:
  record = json_response['data']

  # Save enrichment data to JSON file
  with open("my_pdl_enrichment_preview.jsonl", "w") as out:
    out.write(json.dumps(record) + "\n")
else:
  print("Enrichment preview unsuccessful. See error and try again.")
  print("error:", json_response)
```

```
curl -X GET -G \
  'https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich/preview' \
  -H 'X-Api-Key: xxxx' \
  --data-urlencode 'email=sean@peopledatalabs.com'
```

## Response Format

The Preview Enrichment API is a wrapper on the Person Enrichment API, meaning it returns all of [the same fields](/docs/fields) as the Person Enrichment API, but with **true / false** values instead (**true** meaning we have a value for that field and **false** meaning we do not have a value for it).

Any nested objects will not be included in the Preview Enrichment response. For example, if a record has data for the `education` field, the response will have `"education": true`, but will not list any of the subfields (such as `education.major`).

To help users know which record they're looking at, the following fields will have the actual data if it exists for the record: `id`, `full_name`, `sex`, `linkedin_url`, `industry`, `job_title`, `job_title_levels`, `job_company_name`, `job_company_website`, `location_name`. All other fields will have true/false values as described above.

The output is formatted as such:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data` | `Object` | The person response object. |
| `status` | `Integer` | The HTTP status code. |
| `likelihood` | `Integer` | The likelihood score. |

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/quickstart-person-enrichment-api

## Getting Started

In order to use our Person Enrichment API, you must have an active API key. You can look up your API key by logging into our [self-serve dashboard](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/main/api-keys) and going to the **API Keys** section.

> 👍
>
> ### Need an API Key?
>
> If you don't have an API key, you can easily create one by [signing up](https://peopledatalabs.com/signup) for a self-serve account. For more information, check out our [Self-Serve Quickstart Guide](https://blog.peopledatalabs.com/post/self-signup-api-quickstart), which walks you through the sign-up process as well as shows you how to use the self-serve API dashboard.

## Simple Example

As mentioned in the [Overview](/docs/person-enrichment-api#overview), the Person Enrichment API is a means of performing a one-to-one match of an individual with those included in our [Person Dataset](/docs/fields). In order to use the Person Enrichment API, **you will need at least one of the[input parameters](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api) of the API**.

Here's a quick example that demonstrates retrieving a record with a [`profile`](fields#profile) of `http://linkedin.com/in/seanthorne`:

Python3 SDKcURLJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
import json

# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
)

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
    "profile": ["linkedin.com/in/seanthorne"]
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
json_response = CLIENT.person.enrichment(**PARAMS).json()

# Print the API response in JSON format
print(json_response)
```

```
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich?api_key=xxxx&profile=linkedin.com/in/seanthorne'
```

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLJSClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: "YOUR API KEY" });

// Create a parameters JSON object
const params = {
  profile: "http://linkedin.com/in/seanthorne"
}

// Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
PDLJSClient.person.enrichment(params).then((jsonResponse) => {
  // Print the API response in JSON format
  console.log(jsonResponse);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
```

```
require 'json'

# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-ruby
require 'peopledatalabs'

# Set your API key
Peopledatalabs.api_key = 'YOUR API KEY'

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
    profile: ['linkedin.com/in/seanthorne']
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
json_response = Peopledatalabs::Enrichment.person(params: PARAMS)

# Print the API response in JSON format
puts JSON.dump(json_response)
```

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "encoding/json"
    "context"
)

// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go
import (
    pdl "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go"
    pdlmodel "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go/model"
)

func main() {
    // Set your API key
    apiKey := "YOUR API KEY"
    // Set API key as environmental variable
    // apiKey := os.Getenv("API_KEY")

    // Create a client, specifying your API key
    client := pdl.New(apiKey)
    
    // Create a parameters JSON object
    params := pdlmodel.EnrichPersonParams {
        PersonParams: pdlmodel.PersonParams {
            Profile: []string{"linkedin.com/in/seanthorne"},
        },
    }

    // Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
    response, err := client.Person.Enrich(context.Background(), params)
    
    // Convert the API response to JSON
    jsonResponse, jsonErr := json.Marshal(response.Data)

    // Print the API response
    if err == nil && jsonErr == nil {
        fmt.Println(string(jsonResponse))
    }  
}
```

```
import requests

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY"

# Set the Person Enrichment API URL
PDL_URL = "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich"

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
    "api_key": API_KEY,
    "profile": ["linkedin.com/in/seanthorne"]
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
json_response = requests.get(PDL_URL, params=PARAMS).json()

# Print the API response in JSON format
print(json_response)
```

The API will return the matching person record if the LinkedIn URL passed to it exists in our dataset.

The result of running the above code should be the profile for Sean Thorne (the CEO of People Data Labs) from our Person Dataset. To see Sean's full profile that would be returned in the `data` object, check out our [Example Person Record](/docs/example-record).

JSON

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "likelihood": 10,
  "data": {
    "id": "qEnOZ5Oh0poWnQ1luFBfVw_0000",
    "full_name": "sean thorne",
    ...
  }
}
```

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/bulk-enrichment-api

## Overview

The Bulk Enrichment API provides a way to enrich multiple profiles using the [Person Enrichment API](/docs/person-enrichment-api) in one request.

> 📘
>
> ### Bulk Enrichment vs Person Search
>
> The Bulk Enrichment API is **NOT** the same as the [Person Search API](/docs/person-search-api).
>
> The Bulk Enrichment API is the same as calling the [Person Enrichment API](/docs/person-enrichment-api) multiple times.
>
> Use the Bulk Enrichment API when you want to get detailed profiles for a set of people you already know (such as getting the work history of each person in a list of job candidate emails). Use the Person Search API to find an undetermined number of people that match your search criteria (such as finding possible job candidates based on their work history).

## Request Format

The endpoint for the bulk enrichment api is `POST https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/bulk`.

You can enrich up to 100 persons in a single request.

The request body must contain an array called `requests` with 1-100 individual request objects, each containing a `params` object for each request's parameters.

| Field Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requests` | All requests to make in the bulk enrichment. | `Array [Object]` |
| `params` | The parameters for a single enrichment call. | `Object` |

JSON

```
{
  "requests": [
    {
      "params": {
        ...
      }
    },
    {
      "params": {
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

See [Input Parameters - Person Enrichment API](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api) for details on the supported Enrichment API parameters.

## Response Format

Bulk Enrichment responses are a **JSON Array** of objects with the following fields:

| Field Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data` | The person response object. | `Object` |
| `status` | The HTTP status code. | `Integer` |
| `likelihood` | The likelihood score. | `Integer` |
| `metadata` | Any metadata that the user included in the request. [OPTIONAL] | `Object` |

**Note**: Metadata is on a per-request basis, and generally you should use it to connect requests to responses within a call. See [this section](/docs/bulk-enrichment-api#tracking-responses) for more information.

JSON

```
[
	{"status": 200, "likelihood": 10, "data": ...},
	{"status": 200, "likelihood": 10, "data": ...}
]
```

The order the objects appear in the response list is the same as the order of the `params` in the input `requests` array.

Each response contains an individual status code that shows whether the enrichment for that particular request was successful (`200`) or not. See [Errors](/docs/errors) for a detailed breakdown on all possible status codes.

We will deduct the number of remaining Enrichment credits in your account by the number of `200` status responses in a Bulk Enrichment request as though you made each request individually.

## Tracking Responses

The API always returns response objects in the same order as they were defined in the `requests` array. You can also add an optional `metadata` object to each request, containing any information specific to that request. If you define `metadata` in a request object, the API will return it unchanged in that request's corresponding response object:

## Global Filtering and Formatting

You can define any of the response filtering or formatting parameters documented in the [Input Parameters - Person Enrichment API](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api) page globally for all request objects.

Any response filtering and formatting parameters that you define within in an individual `params` object will override those defined in the global request body.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/data-types

The Schema pages contain every available field for each dataset. Each field has a listed type. This page includes additional details about the supported data types if they differ from the industry standard definition.

# Array [Enum (String)]

A comma separated list of enumerated values. You can find the enumerated values here: [Canonical Field Values](/docs/canonical-data).

# Array [Object]

A comma separated list of objects. Our [`naics`](/docs/company-schema#naics) field demonstrates this concept.

# Dates

Dates can be accurate to the day (`YYYY-MM-DD`), the month (`YYYY-MM`) or the year (`YYYY`). The most specific date value that we have for a field will be used. In general, dates are stored as `String` values. The `founded` field in the [Company Schema](/docs/company-schema) is stored as an `Integer` data type and describes the year the company was founded.

# Enum (String)

A string that contains one of our enumerated values. You can find the enumerated values here: [Canonical Field Values](/docs/canonical-data).

# Integer (>=0) or (1-5) or (>0)

Our integers are general positive values and some fields, like [`languages.proficiency`](/docs/fields#languages), have a limited range of observed values.

# Object

Fields with this data type contain nested data values. Our [`experience`](/docs/fields#experience) and [`education`](/docs/fields#education) fields demonstrate this concept.

# Strings

Unless otherwise stated in the Schema page for a field, all strings will be lowercase with all leading or trailing whitespace removed.

# Examples

When specifying query parameters within a URL, you should separate them with an ampersand (`&`). When specifying query parameters within a JSON object, you should use lists for the request parameters.

We've provided code samples in cURL, Python, Ruby, Go and JavaScript. If you aren't comfortable working in any of these languages, feel free to use this [handy tool](https://curl.trillworks.com/) to convert code from cURL to the language of your choice.

## Multiple Values for the Same Parameter

Most query parameters can take multiple values. To do so, append the parameter with values as many times as needed. The only parameters that **cannot** exist multiple times are `locality`, `region`, `country` and `street_address`, as these are linearly related and multiple inputs would make it impossible to match. To match multiple locations, use the `location` parameter.

## Using POST Requests

*"I want to use POST requests instead of GET requests so that I can make queries with a lot of parameters."*

> 📘
>
> ### Difference Between GET and POST Requests
>
> See this article for a comparison of the [differences between GET and POST requests](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp). The biggest difference is that POST requests don't have any limits on the amount of data that you can pass in the request.

## Overview

The Person Enrichment API enables you to enrich data on a person by performing a one-to-one match of this person with the nearly three billion individual profiles that are hosted in our dataset. Once matched, you have access to all the fields in our [Person Schema](/docs/fields), which can include names, addresses, employment information and social media accounts.

## What's Next

Please check out the following pages for more information on the Person Enrichment API:

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/last_updated-field

As described in [Data Updates](/docs/data-updates), keeping our `experience` and `locations` objects current is one of our primary focuses. Here we outline how we communicate these updates to customers across both fields.

## `job_` and `location_` fields

Every `experience` and `locations` object has an `is_primary` field that contains a boolean value. For a single profile, there will be *at most* one profile tagged as primary. This profile will appear in the flattened `job_` and `location_` fields. The primary values are the ones we believe to be the most recent/relevant object from the `experience`/`locations` array.

## `last_updated` Field

The `last_updated` field exists for both `locations` objects and the top-level experience object (as the [`job_last_verified`](docs:fields#job_last_verified) field). It indicates the last time one of our [Data Union partners](/docs/data-sources) saw a person's location and/or current job "in the wild." Since many of our data partners are themselves focused on data accuracy, we are able to utilize their timestamps to accurately map when this value was last seen. The `last_updated` date does not necessarily indicate that a change in the field occurred but when the most recent data source was provided this data and confirmed its accuracy.

## Look Up a Company Profile Using the Company Enrichment API

Next, let’s look at some records in the [Company Dataset](/docs/company-stats).

Just as you used the Person Enrichment API to retrieve the profile of a specific person, you can use the [Company Enrichment API](/docs/company-enrichment-api) to retrieve the profile of a specific company. Let’s retrieve the record for People Data Labs using our LinkedIn profile: `linkedin.com/company/peopledatalabs/`

## Sending your first request

Copy the following URL and paste it into a new tab in your browser.

> ❗️
>
> ### Before pasting the URL
>
> * Replace `XXXX` after `api_key` with your API key
> * This will **consume 1 API credit** of your free 100 monthly credits for the Company Enrichment API. To read more about credits, check out this [Help Center article](https://support.peopledatalabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/23553812020891-Pricing-Overview)

URL

```
https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/enrich?api_key=XXXX&pretty=True&profile=linkedin.com/company/peopledatalabs
```

The result should look something like this:

> 📘
>
> ### Pro tip
>
> If you want a better way to work with the result in a browser, consider downloading a [JSON Formatting extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?pli=1)

As with records in our Person Dataset, company profiles in our Company Dataset are stored as JSON objects, and they contain information for the fields in our [Company Schema](/docs/company-fields).

### Try Looking Up Another Company Profile

Next, try looking up another company profile. This time, find your favorite company on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). For example, [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/). Go to the company’s profile page and copy the URL.

As you should now be trying to get a feel for the type of data available within in the PDL datasets, try a few different LinkedIn URLs. Here are some examples:

* `https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/`
* `https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon/`
* `https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple/`

Once you have chosen a LinkedIn URL, run the following command:

> ❗️
>
> ### Before pasting the URL
>
> * Replace `XXXX` after `api_key` with your API key
> * Replace `YYYY` after `profile` with the desired LinkedIn URL
> * This will **consume 1 API credit** of your free 100 monthly credits for the Company Enrichment API. To read more about credits, check out this [Help Center article](https://support.peopledatalabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/23553812020891-Pricing-Overview)

Shell

```
https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/enrich?api_key=XXXX&pretty=True&profile=YYYY
```

In the response, you should see either:

* The full PDL company profile associated with the LinkedIn URL that you submitted.
* An [error](/docs/errors) indicating that no matching record could be found, in which case you can try one of the example LinkedIn URLs listed above.

We encourage you to look up a number of company profiles to get a sense of the type of coverage and information that our datasets offer.

# Base Company Fields

These fields are available to all customers by default.

## Identifiers

### `id`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The identifier for the company. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

The ID is a unique, hashed value that represents a specific company record.

#### Example

JSON

```
"id": "tnHcNHbCv8MKeLh92946LAkX6PKg"
```

### `name`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The company's main common name. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

The company name will be lowercase with any leading/trailing whitespace removed. It is **not** guaranteed to be unique.

For the correct capitalization of the company name, see [`display_name`](#display_name).

The name value returned here does not undergo much cleaning or standardization. However, we clean and tokenize company names behind the scenes so they can be found using the [Company Search API](/docs/company-search-api). To see how company name cleaning works, check out the [Company Cleaner API](/docs/cleaner-apis#companyclean).

#### Example

JSON

```
"name": "people data labs"
```

### `display_name`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The company name, capitalized using the company’s self-reported name. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

The `display_name` field preserves the capitalization of the company name (unlike [`name`](#name) which is always lowercase). `display_name` is set using the company’s self-reported name, so it should be accurate even for companies with non-standard capitalization (such as VMware, FedEx, or Dell EMC).

Use this field to display properly capitalized company names in a UI or other customer-facing project or product.

#### Example

JSON

```
"display_name": "VMware"
```

## Company Information

### `affiliated_profiles`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | [Company IDs](#id) that are affiliated with the queried company (parents and subsidiaries.) |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

A list of [Company IDs](#id) that we have flagged as having an association to this company (either a parent or a subsidiary.) See [Parents and Subsidiaries](#parents-and-subsidiaries) for fields based on specific company associations.

#### Example

JSON

```
"affiliated_profiles": [
    "a1cpOkL4SHp0wSAKjbCeuwtAlno0",
    "3WBa1kollMtBbib5DoiCwwhyD9ks"
  ]
```

### `alternative_domains`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A list of alternate domains associated with this company. |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

If a company rebrands or otherwise changes its primary domain, old company websites will be kept in this list.

See [`website`](#website) for how we handle domains.

#### Example

JSON

```
"alternative_domains": [
    "peopledatalabs.com",
    "talentiq.co",
    "peopledatalabs.co"
  ]
```

### `alternative_names`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A list of names associated with this company. |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

A list of [names](#name) associated with the company filtered to ensure data quality.

#### Example

JSON

```
"alternative_names": [
    "people data labs",
    "people data labs inc",
    "talentiq"
  ]
```

### `employee_count`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The current number of employees working at the company based on our number of profiles. |
| Data Type | `Integer (>= 0)` |

#### Field Details

`employee_count` is an integer greater than or equal to zero. We calculate it by finding the number of profiles whose `experience.company.id`  matches the company with a non-null `job_start_date` and no end date.

For the company's self-reported size range, use the [`size`](#size) field instead. For more information about the different types of employee count data we provide, see [Employee Count Fields](/docs/employee-count-fields).

This number may be higher or lower than a company's real employee count depending on how many false positives and false negatives we have in our data as well as missing or duplicate individuals.

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_count": 78
```

### `employee_count_by_country`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The number of current employees broken out by country. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

Each country will be one of our [Canonical Countries](/docs/location-countries). For more information about how each count is calculated, see [Employee Count Breakdowns](/docs/company-schema#employee-count-breakdowns).

Beginning in v25.0, this field will also contain an `other_uncategorized` subfield. Profiles that we have associated with the company but do not have enough information to assign a location to will be included in this field. For more information, see [Employee Count Fields](/docs/employee-count-fields).

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_count_by_country": {
    "united states": 67,
    "canada": 2,
    "india": 1,
    "bangladesh": 1,
    "other_uncategorized": 2
  }
```

### `founded`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The founding year of the company. |
| Data Type | `Integer (> 0)` |

#### Field Details

The founding year will be an integer greater than zero. If no year is found, it will be `null`.

If different sources list different founding years, we will choose the year that appears in the most sources. If multiple years appear in the same number of sources, we will use the latest year.

#### Example

JSON

```
"founded": 2015
```

### `headline`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The company’s headline summary. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

`headline` is a short description of the company, limited to 300 characters.

#### Example

JSON

```
"headline": "Your Single Source of Truth"
```

### `size`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A range representing the number of people working at the company. |
| Data Type | `Enum (String)` |

#### Field Details

The value of this field will be one of our canonical [Company Sizes](/docs/company-sizes). We derive it from the company's self-reported size on their social media profile.

For the true number of employees, use the [`employee_count`](#employee_count) field.

#### Example

JSON

```
"size": "11-50"
```

### `summary`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A description of the company. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

The company summary is a lowercase string and can contain escape characters such as `\n`. The string is limited to a maximum of 1000 characters.

#### Example

```
  "summary": "people data labs builds people data. \n\nuse our dataset
              of 1.5 billion unique person profiles to build products,
              enrich person profiles, power predictive modeling/ai,
              analysis, and more. we work with technical teams as their
              engineering focused people data partner. \n\nwe work with
              thousands of data science teams as their engineering focused
              people data partner. these include enterprises like adidas,
              ebay, and acxiom, as well as startups like madison logic,
              zoho, and workable. we are a deeply technical company, and
              are backed by two leading engineering venture capital firms
              - founders fund and 8vc.",
```

### `tags`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Tags associated with the company. |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

Each tag is a lowercase string.

There may be tags that seem to overlap (for example: `"data"`, `"analytics"` and `"data and analytics"`). This is intentional so that it is easier to search for companies matching a tag.

#### Example

JSON

```
"tags": [
    "data",
    "people data",
    "data science",
    "artificial intelligence",
    "data and analytics",
    "machine learning",
    "analytics",
    "database",
    "software",
    "developer apis"
   ]
```

### `website`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The primary company website. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

This field contains the address of the primary company website associated with the record.

We standardize websites by removing `https://www.` and any additional subdomains and paths (with certain exceptions). Popular hosting platforms (like Facebook, Blogspot, Wix, etc.) will retain their subdomains and paths. For example, `samspizza.blogspot.com` or `etsy.com/sams-pizza`.

Websites using link shortening services (like Bit.ly, TinyURL, ShortURL, etc.) will appear in full.

We have a list of invalid URL items (domains, subdomains and TLDs) that we check against. We also check if an iteration of the company name appears in the website address as a simple validation.

Ideally, this is the website address that people commonly use when accessing a company's site (such as `facebook.com`) and not an alias (such as `fb.com`).

As with [Social Presence](#social-presence), we do **not** verify that the website is valid.

#### Example

JSON

```
"website": "peopledatalabs.com"
```

| --- | --- |
| Description | An array of objects containing the industry classifications for a company according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). A company can (and frequently does) have multiple NAICS codes. |
| Data Type | `Array [Object]` |

#### Field Details

Each NAICS code associated with the company will be included in the list. For each NAICS code, we provide the actual six-digit code as well as the official description for each level of the NAICS code.

PDL uses [NAICS 2017 industry categorization](https://www.bls.gov/cew/classifications/industry/home.htm).

PDL offers self-reported NAICS industry categorizations within the company data, where this data serves as an alternative to Industry and SIC for users to categorize or segment companies. Because the data PDL publishes represents self-reported data where the industry values were selected by employees of those companies prior to the 2022 revision, we have not bulk converted to, or inferred, NAICS 2022 categories for our existing NAICS values.

A NAICS code doesn’t have to use all six digits. Any unspecified field(s) in our data will have a `null` value.

| Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `naics_code` | `String` | The NAICS code associated with a company’s industry classification. [See canonical values](/docs/naics-codes). |
| `sector` | `String` | The industry classification according to the first two digits in the NAICS code. [See canonical values](/docs/naics-sectors). |

      "industry_group": "computer programming, data processing, and other computer related services",
      "industry_sector": "prepackaged software"
    },
    ...
   ]
```

## Primary Location

### `location`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | An object containing increasingly granular information about the location of the company’s current headquarters. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

A company's location is the location of its Headquarters (HQ). We determine a company’s current Headquarters/primary office based on the location that we see most often in our sources.

#### Field Details

`mic_exchange` represents the Market Identified Code (MIC) standard exchange code corresponding to the stock exchange of the company.

The value of `mic_exchange` will always be one of our [Canonical MIC Codes](/docs/mic-codes) or `null` if there is no [ticker](#ticker).

#### Example

JSON

```
"mic_exchange": "xnams"
```

### `ticker`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The company ticker (only for public companies.) |
| Data Type | `String (Uppercase)` |

#### Field Details

`ticker` is the uppercase string of the company’s stock symbol.

#### Example

JSON

```
"type": "private"
```

## Social Presence

We currently include company social profiles for LinkedIn, Yellow Pages, Xing, Twitter, Facebook and Crunchbase. Any profiles that we find for the company from these sources will be added to the [`profiles`](#profiles) list.

Each social profile URL has one or more standard formats that we parse and turn into a standard PDL format for that social URL. We invalidate profiles that have non-valid company stubs (for example, `linkedin.com/in`), and we also have a blacklist of usernames that we know are invalid.

We do **not** validate if a URL is valid (that is, whether you can access it) because doing this at scale is considered a Direct Denial of Service (DDoS) attack and/or a form of crawling. This is highly discouraged! We try to mitigate invalid URLs as much as possible by using Entity Resolution (Merging) to link URLs together and then tagging the primary URL at the top level for key networks.

### `linkedin_id`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The main LinkedIn profile ID for the company based on source agreement. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

To support our [upcoming change to PDL Company IDs](/changelog/january-2024-release-notes-v25#company-id), we are adding the new `linkedin_slug` field. This field is generated in the same way as our [current company `id` field](/docs/company-schema#id).

For new company records that do not have associated LinkedIn pages, this field will be null.

#### Example

JSON

```
"linkedin_slug": "peopledatalabs"
```

### `linkedin_url`

# Company Insights Fields

Premium fields presenting summaries of the employee headcount and trends, built by aggregating data from from our [Person Dataset](/docs/fields).

## Average Employee Tenure

Average employee tenure is the average number of years employees work for the company. It is represented by a floating number greater than zero and rounded to the nearest thousandth. It could skew lower if there have been a lot of recent hires.

The average is calculated using `experience.start_date` and `experience.end_date` for each employee found in our Person records.

If no start date is given or if a date only contains a year but no month, then the experience is not counted toward the average.

### `average_employee_tenure`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The average years of experience at the company. |
| Data Type | `Float (> 0)` |

#### Field Details

This insight shows the average number of years that employees at the company have worked based on `experience.start_date` and `experience.end_date`.

#### Example

JSON

```
"average_employee_tenure": 2.75
```

### `average_tenure_by_level`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The average years of experience at the company by job level. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

This insight shows the average number of years that employees at the company have worked broken out by their level at the company. The average for each level is calculated using the same logic as [`average_employee_tenure`](#average_employee_tenure).

The level names come from `experience.title.levels`, meaning they will always be one of the [Canonical Job Levels](/docs/job-title-levels).

#### Example

JSON

```
"average_tenure_by_level": {
    "entry": 0.3,
    "unpaid": 2.0,
    "senior": 6.0,
    "director": 3.0,
    "vp": 2.4,
    "training": 0.2,
    "manager": 4.0,
    "owner": 3.2,
    "partner": 2.4,
    "cxo": 8.1
  }
```

### `average_tenure_by_role`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The average years of experience at the company by job role. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

This insight shows the average number of years that employees at the company have worked broken out by their role at the company. The average for each role is calculated using the same logic as [`average_employee_tenure`](#average_employee_tenure).

The role names come from `experience.title.role`, meaning they will always be one of the [Canonical Job Roles](/docs/job-title-roles).

#### Example

JSON

```
"average_tenure_by_role": {
    "real_estate": 4.5,
    "design": 2.0,
    "trades": 3.2,
    "marketing": 0.1,
    "education": 6.5,
    "legal": 8.0,
    "customer_service": 4.0,
    "finance": 5.0,
    "public_relations": 8.1,
    "engineering": 2.1,
    "human_resources": 0.5,
    "media": 0.4,
    "sales": 0.6,
    "operations": 0.1,
    "health": 2.0
  }
```

## Employee Count Breakdowns

The count for each category will always be an integer value greater than or equal to zero.

This number may be higher or lower than a company's real employee count depending on how many false positives and false negatives we have in our data, missing and duplicate individuals, and missing information on start dates and job roles.

If no start date is given, then the experience is not counted.

For the overall employee count, see [`employee_count`](#employee_count). For the company's self-reported size, see [`size`](#size).

Note that discrepancies between the [`employee_count`](#employee_count), the most recent [`employee_count_by_month`](#employee_count_by_month), and aggregated[`employee_count_by_month_by_role`](#employee_count_by_month_by_role) and [`employee_count_by_month_by_level`](#employee_count_by_month_by_level) counts are expected. For more information about the logic used to calculate these values, see [this page](/docs/employee-count-fields).

### `employee_count_by_month`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The number of employees at the end of each month. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The total number of profiles associated with this company at the end of each month in the format `YYYY-MM`. The date range begins at the start date of the first associated employee or January 1, 2010, whichever is most recent. The final month in the range will be the last full month before the last monthly [Data Build](/docs/data-build). Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain all data up to that February.

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_count_by_month": {
    "2021-07": 84,
    "2021-08": 86,
    "2021-09": 84
  }
```

### `employee_count_by_month_by_level`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The number of employees at the end of each month, broken down by job level. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The total number of profiles associated with this company at the end of each month in the format `YYYY-MM` broken down by `experience.title.levels`. The level names will always be one of the [Canonical Job Levels](/docs/job-title-levels).

The date range begins at the start date of the first associated employee or January 1, 2010, whichever is most recent. The final month in the range will be the last full month before the last monthly [Data Build](/docs/data-build). Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain all data up to that February.

If a person changes levels within a company during the same month, they will be counted in the same month towards both levels. An individual may have more than a single level for the same experience object, in which case they will contribute towards multiple levels.

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_count_by_month_by_level": {
    "2015-03": {
      "partner": 0,
      "vp": 0,
      "owner": 1,
      "entry": 0,
      "director": 0,
      "unpaid": 0,
      "senior": 0,
      "cxo": 1,
      "manager": 0,
      "training": 0
    },
    ...
    "2021-06": {
      "partner": 0,
      "vp": 3,
      "owner": 1,
      "entry": 10,

      "training": 0
    }
  }
```

### `employee_count_by_month_by_role`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The number of employees at the end of each month, broken down by job role. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The total number of profiles associated with this company at the end of each month in the format `YYYY-MM` broken down by `experience.title.role`. The role names will always be one of the [Canonical Job Roles](/docs/job-title-roles).

The date range begins at the start date of the first associated employee or January 1, 2010, whichever is most recent. The final month in the range will be the last full month before the last monthly [Data Build](/docs/data-build). Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain all data up to that February.

If a person changes roles with a company during the same month, they will only be counted for a single role.

Beginning in v25.0, each month will also contain an `other_uncategorized` subfield. Profiles that we have associated with the company but do not have enough information to assign a role to will be included in this field. For more information, see [Employee Count Fields](/docs/employee-count-fields).

## Employee Growth and Churn Rates

All calculation time frames are based on the month that you make the request. If you make the request in April, the three-month rate will use data from January onward.

If no start date is given, then the experience is not counted.

Additionally, if a date only contains a year but no month, it is assumed to be to be January for start dates and December (or the current month if December is in the future) for end dates.

### `employee_churn_rate`

This is a representation of net employee turnover. The churn rate is rounded to four decimal points and is always greater than or equal to 0. If the company had 0 employees or did not exist at the start time for a specific window, then the churn rate is `null`.

Churn rate is calculated as `max(employee_count_n_months_ago - employee_count_current, 0)/employee_count_n_months_ago`. For example, if a company has 200 employees at the beginning of the month, and at the end of the month 100 leave and 100 remain then its churn rate = 100 / 200 = 0.5.

| Field | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| `3_month` | `Float (>= 0)` |
| `6_month` | `Float (>= 0)` |
| `12_month` | `Float (>= 0)` |
| `24_month` | `Float (>= 0)` |

#### Example

JSON

```

### `employee_growth_rate`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The percentage increase in total headcount from N months prior. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The growth rate is rounded to four decimal points and can be negative if the current number of employees is less than in the past. If the company had zero employees or did not exist at the start time for a specific window, then the growth rate is `null`.

Growth rate is calculated as `(current_employee_count / previous_employee_count) - 1`. For example, if a company has 100 employees at the beginning of the month, and at the end of the month has grown to 200 employees then its growth rate = (200 / 100) - 1 = 1.0.

| Field | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| `3_month` | `Float` |
| `6_month` | `Float` |
| `12_month` | `Float` |
| `24_month` | `Float` |

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_growth_rate": {

### `employee_growth_rate_12_month_by_class`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The twelve month rate of change by [Job Title Class](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/job-title-class). |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The 12 month growth rate of the total number of profiles associated with this company at the end of the most recent month in the format `YYYY-MM` broken down by `experience.title.class`. The role names will always be one of the [Canonical Job Title Class](/docs/job-title-class) labels. This field will also contain an `other_uncategorized` subfield that contains profiles we have associated with the company but do not have enough information to assign a role to.

The growth rate is rounded to four decimal points and can be negative if the current number of employees is less than in the past. If the company had zero employees or did not exist at the start time for a specific window, then the growth rate is `null`.

Growth rate is calculated as `(current_employee_count / previous_employee_count) - 1`. For example, if a company has 100 employees at the beginning of the month 12 months ago, and at the end of the most recent month has grown to 200 employees then its growth rate = (200 / 100) - 1 = 1.0.

The 12 month growth rate will be computed using the last full month before the last monthly Data Build. Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain the 12 month growth rate from February."

## Gross Additions and Departures

This insight shows the total number of employees that joined or left the company each month.

The count for each month will always be an integer greater than or equal to zero. The month range begins at the start date of the first associated employee or January 1, 2010, whichever is most recent. The final month in the range will be the last full month before the last monthly [Data Build](/docs/data-build). Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain all data up to that February.

This number may be higher or lower than a company's real employee count depending on how many false positives and false negatives we have in our data, missing and duplicate individuals, and missing information on start/end dates.

If a start or end date is not given or only contains a year but no month, it is not counted. This differs from [`employee_count_by_month`](#employee_count_by_month) that assumes January if there is no month.

## Inferred Revenue

### `inferred_revenue`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Company's estimated annual revenue range in US dollars. |

#### Field Details

A company's inferred revenue is an estimated range of its annual revenue in US dollars and can be used as a filter in [Company Search queries](/docs/company-search-api).

The revenue estimate is calculated using a predictive model that factors in details generated for our [Company Insights Fields](#company-insights-fields) (for example, [employee\_count\_by\_month\_by\_role](#employee_count_by_month_by_role)) as well as for other inputs that have been shown to be highly correlative.

The range will be one of our [Canonical Inferred Revenue Ranges](/docs/inferred-revenue-ranges).

#### Example

```
"inferred_revenue": "$10M-$25M"
```

## Recent Executive Changes

These insights provide details on executives that have joined or left the company in the past three months at the time you make the request.

There is no limit on the number of executives that can be in either list. To determine if someone is an executive, we check if their `experience.title.levels` in the company matches `CXO`, `owner` or `VP`. If no level is specified, then the experience is not counted.

If a start or end date is not given for an executive, then the experience is not counted. If the date only contains a year, the month is assumed to be January.

## Top Next and Previous Employers

The top ten next and previous companies employees are broken down by job role.

Companies are listed using their [PDL Company ID](#id).

The first list of companies will be under the `"all"` key. This represents the top 10 companies for any role.

The roles are based on the employee’s role at the company queried. Each role listed in the break down will come from the [Canonical Job Roles](/docs/job-title-roles).

If no start date is given or no role exists, then the experience is not counted.

If there are fewer than ten next/previous employers for a role, it will return as many as there are.

| Description | The top ten previous companies employees worked for and how many current employees were previously employed by them. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

This insight uses `experience.title.role` and `experience.start_date` to find the top previous employers. Companies are ranked by the number of current employees previously employed there.

A company is considered to be a "previous employer" if the employee has a start date before their start date for the company being queried.

#### Example

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/email-data-for-outreach

## Overview

PDL provides many email-related fields to support a variety of different use cases, ranging from powering direct outreach to matching profiles for entity resolution.

In this guide we’ll focus specifically on using PDL’s email data for **email outreach**. This includes powering your outreach campaigns, supplying contact info in your platform to your own end users, and any other scenario where the intention is to use PDL’s email data to reach out to a specific target audience.

This page will explain which fields to use, which to avoid, and why.

> 📘
>
> **TLDR**
>
> For email outreach, **use only**:
>
> * ✅ [`recommended_personal_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)
> * ✅ [`work_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)
>
> Do **not** use:
>
> * ❌ [`emails`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)
> * ❌ [`personal_emails`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)
>
> The latter two fields include historical emails and have lower deliverability rates.

## Which email fields should you use?

The only fields that PDL recommends using for email outreach are the following two fields:

* [`recommended_personal_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)
* [`work_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)

These two fields are intended to represent a person’s **current** personal and work email and are the best-suited fields for connecting with a person. Furthermore, as of October 2025, we have also increased our efforts to validate the deliverability of emails in these two fields ([more details below](#pdl-email-deliverability-improvements)).

[`recommended_personal_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)

* Best available ***personal*** email for outreach
* Ideal for **non-work-related communication**
* Optimized for direct contact and higher deliverability
* Selected from the `personal_emails` field

[`work_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)

* Most up-to-date ***professional*** email address
* Intended for **business-related outreach**
* Optimized to reduce bounces from outdated work emails

### Which to use?

Which you use depends on your specific goals, but a general pattern we see with our users is:

* **Recruiting/Candidate Outreach** use cases tend to leverage the [`recommended_personal_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields) field in order to connect with candidates outside of their work inbox
* **Sales/Marketing Outreach** use cases tend to prefer the [`work_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields) field in order to reach contacts within their professional work environment.

## What about PDL's other email fields?

In the Person Schema, you will find several other email-related fields alongside the two mentioned above:

* [`emails`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)
* [`personal_emails`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields)

However, unlike the [`recommended_personal_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields) and [`work_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields) fields, these fields are meant to track **both current and historical** emails, with the primary goal being entity resolution (e.g. matching data to a profile based on any of the emails ever associated with that individual).

As a result, **we do not make any efforts to ensure the current or deliverability status of the emails in these fields**, and only focus on ensuring that the emails can be confidently associated to a profile at any point in its history.

Therefore, we **strongly discourage** the use of these fields in your outreach efforts, especially without additional effort on your part to ensure the emails are deliverable and active.

> ⚠️
>
> **What happens if you use historical emails for outreach?**
>
> Using outdated or inactive emails in your outreach can significantly harm both campaign performance and, more importantly, your sender reputation. These addresses increase bounce rates, trigger spam complaints, and waste valuable resources.
>
> A damaged sender reputation - marked by high bounces and low engagement - causes emails to be filtered into spam folders or blocked entirely, making it difficult to reach your audience. Because sender reputation takes a long time to recover, the consequences of poor list hygiene can be long-lasting.

## Email outreach best practices

> 📘
>
> **PDL Email Outreach Best Practice Guide**
>
> As a resource for our users, here is an in-depth guide on Email Outreach Best Practices, created by our Solutions Engineering Team:
>
> [A Practical Guide for Effective Email Outreach](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/pdf/email-outreach-guide.pdf)

Apart from using the correct email fields, there are some key best practices that we strongly encourage our users to follow when launching and running their outreach campaigns. These include:

1. Validating Emails to minimize bounce rates
2. Leverage domain warmup strategies to protect sender reputation
3. Ongoing monitoring of campaign performance metrics

These are covered in detail in our email outreach best practice guide linked at the top of this section.

The one we will take a closer look at here is **email validation**

### Email Validation

Whether you are getting your emails from PDL or any other data provider, it is important to always ensure the deliverability of any emails you intend to use in your outreach. As we explained above, any inactive or non-deliverable emails that get included in your outreach can have extremely damaging long-term effects on your ability to send outreach in the future.

> Emails can become inactive or invalid at any time, and so even previously validated emails should be revalidated immediately before outreach. This is true for any emails you use whether they come from PDL or other providers.

**Recommendations**

Our recommendation is to validate your emails **once a quarter at minimum**, but ideally **immediately before kicking off any large outreach campaigns** or **anytime you begin to notice large drops in deliverability**.

**Email Validation Services**

To validate the deliverability of your emails, there are a variety of trusted validation services available on the market.

PDL customers have access to [discount incentives](https://withlove.usebouncer.com/afiuucaft7je) through our partnership with [Bouncer.com](http://Bouncer.com), but there are many other similar providers available.

The most important thing is that you are able to verify the deliverability status of the emails you intend to use to ensure that you do not include any emails that are no longer active or deliverable.

## PDL Email Deliverability Improvements

In October 2025, PDL kicked off an initiative to revitalize and revamp the way email validation is done on our top-level email fields. In particular, we began validating and removing non-deliverable emails from the [`recommended_personal_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields) and [`work_email`](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/docs/fields) fields.

The goal of this initiative is to ensure higher success rates when using these fields for outreach and to help provide ongoing deliverability validation for these emails. This work is expected to continue into the first few couple quarters of 2026.

**Note that this work does not change our recommendation to continue validating any emails you intend to use for outreach since an email’s deliverability status can change on any given day.**

For more information on these deliverability improvements, please see our [October 2025 (v32.0) Release Notes](/v5.0_email_deliverability_callouts/changelog/october-2025-release-notes-v320) as well as this guide on these changes put together by our Solutions Engineering Team: [PDL Email Deliverability Improvements](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/pdf/email-deliverability-improvements-guide.pdf).

## Wrapping Up

PDL’s email data can be a powerful input for outreach when used correctly. For any email-based outreach use case, always rely on `recommended_personal_email` and `work_email`, as these fields are designed to represent a person’s current contact information and are actively optimized for deliverability.

Avoid using historical email fields like `emails` and `personal_emails` for outreach, as they are intended for entity resolution and can negatively impact campaign performance and sender reputation.

Finally, remember that even high-quality email data requires good hygiene. Regular email validation, ongoing performance monitoring, and adherence to outreach best practices are essential to protecting deliverability and maximizing results. When combined with these practices, PDL’s recommended email fields provide a strong foundation for effective, scalable email outreach.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/errors

Our APIs use conventional HTTP response status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. A `200` means that an API returned a matching record, and a `404` means that an API neither found nor returned a matching record. Any `4xx` code besides a `404` indicates that there was an issue with the request, and `5xx` codes indicate that an internal issue with the API occurred.

## Error & Status Response Fields

When an API call fails (does not return `200` or `404` response code), it will return an error response to help debug what went wrong with the request. The error response will be a JSON object with the following fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `Integer` | The HTTP response status code. |
| `error` | `Object` | The object containing the error type and message. See [error codes](#error-codes) for examples. |
| `error.type` | `String` | The error type. |
| `error.message` | `String` | The error message. |

### Example 404 Response

JSON

```
{
    "status": 404,
    "error": {
        "type": "not_found",
        "message": "No records were found matching your request"
    }
}
```

### Example 429 Response

JSON

```
{
    "status": 429,
    "error": {
        "type": "rate_limit_error",
        "message": "An error occurred due to requests hitting the API too quick"
    }
}
```

## Error Codes

| Status | Status/Error Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | `invalid_request_error` | The request contained either missing or invalid parameters. |
| `401` | `authentication_error` | The request contained a missing or invalid key. |
| `402` | `payment_required` | You have reached your account maximum (all matches have been used). |
| `405` | `invalid_request_error` | You cannot use the request method on the requested resource. |
| `429` | `rate_limit_error` | An error occurred due to requests hitting the API too quick. |
| `5xx` | `api_error` | The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. |

## Status Codes

| Status | Status/Error Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | `request successful` | If Search API, your request was successful. If Enrichment API: your request yielded a match. |
| `404` | `not_found` | While technically labeled as an error in the response, this simply means there were no profiles found matching your request. |

## Best Practice

Use proper error handling techniques for all status codes and error codes. This is especially essential for looped Search API requests.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/canonical-data

# Overview

For several of the field types in our [Person Schema](/docs/fields) and [Company Schema](/docs/company-schema), we have enumerated the standard set of values that they are allowed to take on. For example, we have defined all the degree types that our data can take on with the canonical field values listed in [Education Degrees](/docs/education-degrees).

To see which files correspond to which fields in each schema, see our [person fields](/docs/fields) and [company fields](/docs/company-schema). Please feel free to use any of these that'd be helpful to you.

## Where to Access

Datasets of possible values for many of our fields can be found in this [public Amazon S3 Bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/pdl-prod-schema/). Our current data version is [33.1](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/pdl-prod-schema?region=us-west-2&prefix=33.1/enums/).

We update our canonical data quarterly, either by migrating the same file into a new folder or by updating the file. We will note any updated or changed files in the [Release Notes](/docs/changelog).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/data-formatting

# No Data

Every response object will contain every field listed in the Schema page that the customer has paid for.

If we do not have data for a field, its value will be `null` unless the field is an Array type, in which case its value will be an empty list `[]`.

# Phone Numbers

All phone numbers will be in in [E164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) with a leading `+` and country code. For example, `"+15558675309"`.

# Currencies

Unless otherwise stated in the Schema page for a field, all currency values are in USD.

# Locations

### Localities

We match locations using a strict/fuzzy logic. Our goal is match as many locations as possible to our Location Data entity, linking them based on `location.name`. To tap into our location matching logic, use our [Location Cleaner API](/docs/cleaner-apis) or retrieve possible location values using our [Autocomplete API](/docs/autocomplete-api).

### Addresses

We standardize addresses in the US and Canada using an internal address parser. We do not conform to any standards such as [CASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_Accuracy_Support_System), although we try to imitate them as much as possible.

### Common Location Fields

We break location data into the following fields. These names are used throughout our data to refer to location information.

| Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `String` | Our cleaned values for locations in the format `locality, region, country`. |
| `locality` | `String` | The locality of the address |
| `region` | `String` | The region of the address |
| `metro` | `Enum (String)` | **US ONLY.** These are generated based on the census-designated MSAs and maps. Will be one of our [Canonical Metros](/docs/location-metros). |
| `country` | `Enum (String)` | Standardized format for country. Will be one of our [Canonical Countries](/docs/location-countries). |
| `continent` | `Enum (String)` | Standardized format for continent. Will be one of our [Canonical Continents](/docs/location-continents). |
| `street_address` | `String` | The street address |
| `address_line_2` | `String` | The street address line 2 |
| `postal_code` | `String` | The postal code of the address |
| `geo` | `String` | City-center geo code of a locality, in the format `latitude, longitude` |

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/sandbox-apis

The Sandbox APIs let you query our APIs to access synthetic data without consuming credits. The primary purpose of these endpoints are for testing and evaluating use cases in support of tasks such as:

* Performing integration testing to ensure compatibility with our endpoints and data structures
* Evaluating our APIs without revealing proprietary or regulated data

The Sandbox API endpoints mirror our production API endpoints, meaning that each public API endpoint will eventually have a corresponding sandbox endpoint. Each sandbox endpoint has **identical functionality** as its corresponding production endpoint. However, the records that each sandbox endpoint return contain only **artificial data**, which follows the same object structure as records from our production datasets.

Here is the current status of our Sandbox API endpoints:

Bringing in data from [thousands of sources](/docs/data-sources) surfaces many complicated issues such as standardization, de-duplication and time-stamping data. Here we discuss many of these core product questions in detail.

Additionally, you can access our white paper about our data building process and approach [here](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/resource-lab/datafication/our-data-build-process).

## Standardization

Standardization comes in two forms: ensuring general formatting standards and canonicalizing data.

We lowercase all data and strip leading and trailing whitespace. This ensures normalization across all our data sources since raw data comes in a variety of capitalization formats. We also strip any leading or trailing punctuation that we have deemed non-essential.

Many of our fields are canonicalized into standardized values.

* For some fields, such as for majors and minors, this allows for standardized output and queryability
* For other fields our canonicalized data provides extra information (schools, companies and locations all are enhanced by our canonicalization techniques)
* For job titles in particular, we will attempt to map out acronyms to their full form
  + For example, "ceo" becomes "chief executive officer"
  + "MD" becomes "medical doctor" unless they are in a non-medical industry in which case "MD" becomes "managing director"

## De-Duplication

We de-duplicate our data using both deterministic and probabilistic methods that stem from a blocking/matching logic. We group records on similar values "keys," such as a common email, common name and so forth, and then we compare all records within a "blocking group" to verify if they are in fact a match.

This process is intentionally strict as our primary goal is to avoid false positive merges. Our general philosophy is that false positive merges have significantly more detrimental effects than missing out on a potential match of two largely different values. This philosophy helps define our [datasets](/docs/datasets), ensuring that we minimize the possibility of duplication and that our APIs return as much information as we can confidently provide for any given input.

## Quality Assurance

At the tail end of each [data build](/docs/data-updates), we conduct quality assurance on our data. Our QA process involves hand checking, running aggregations, and significant unit testing to ensure that we have not decreased the quality of data in any way.

# Base Company Fields

These fields are available to all customers by default.

## Identifiers

### `id`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The identifier for the company. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

The ID is a unique, hashed value that represents a specific company record.

#### Example

JSON

```
"id": "tnHcNHbCv8MKeLh92946LAkX6PKg"
```

### `name`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The company's main common name. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

The company name will be lowercase with any leading/trailing whitespace removed. It is **not** guaranteed to be unique.

For the correct capitalization of the company name, see [`display_name`](#display_name).

The name value returned here does not undergo much cleaning or standardization. However, we clean and tokenize company names behind the scenes so they can be found using the [Company Search API](/docs/company-search-api). To see how company name cleaning works, check out the [Company Cleaner API](/docs/cleaner-apis#companyclean).

#### Example

JSON

```
"name": "people data labs"
```

### `display_name`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The company name, capitalized using the company’s self-reported name. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

The `display_name` field preserves the capitalization of the company name (unlike [`name`](#name) which is always lowercase). `display_name` is set using the company’s self-reported name, so it should be accurate even for companies with non-standard capitalization (such as VMware, FedEx, or Dell EMC).

Use this field to display properly capitalized company names in a UI or other customer-facing project or product.

#### Example

JSON

```
"display_name": "VMware"
```

## Company Information

### `affiliated_profiles`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | [Company IDs](#id) that are affiliated with the queried company (parents and subsidiaries.) |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

A list of [Company IDs](#id) that we have flagged as having an association to this company (either a parent or a subsidiary.) See [Parents and Subsidiaries](#parents-and-subsidiaries) for fields based on specific company associations.

#### Example

JSON

```
"affiliated_profiles": [
    "a1cpOkL4SHp0wSAKjbCeuwtAlno0",
    "3WBa1kollMtBbib5DoiCwwhyD9ks"
  ]
```

### `alternative_domains`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A list of alternate domains associated with this company. |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

If a company rebrands or otherwise changes its primary domain, old company websites will be kept in this list.

See [`website`](#website) for how we handle domains.

#### Example

JSON

```
"alternative_domains": [
    "peopledatalabs.com",
    "talentiq.co",
    "peopledatalabs.co"
  ]
```

### `alternative_names`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A list of names associated with this company. |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

A list of [names](#name) associated with the company filtered to ensure data quality.

#### Example

JSON

```
"alternative_names": [
    "people data labs",
    "people data labs inc",
    "talentiq"
  ]
```

### `employee_count`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The current number of employees working at the company based on our number of profiles. |
| Data Type | `Integer (>= 0)` |

#### Field Details

`employee_count` is an integer greater than or equal to zero. We calculate it by finding the number of profiles whose `experience.company.id`  matches the company with a non-null `job_start_date` and no end date.

For the company's self-reported size range, use the [`size`](#size) field instead. For more information about the different types of employee count data we provide, see [Employee Count Fields](/docs/employee-count-fields).

This number may be higher or lower than a company's real employee count depending on how many false positives and false negatives we have in our data as well as missing or duplicate individuals.

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_count": 78
```

### `employee_count_by_country`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The number of current employees broken out by country. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

Each country will be one of our [Canonical Countries](/docs/location-countries). For more information about how each count is calculated, see [Employee Count Breakdowns](/docs/company-schema#employee-count-breakdowns).

Beginning in v25.0, this field will also contain an `other_uncategorized` subfield. Profiles that we have associated with the company but do not have enough information to assign a location to will be included in this field. For more information, see [Employee Count Fields](/docs/employee-count-fields).

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_count_by_country": {
    "united states": 67,
    "canada": 2,
    "india": 1,
    "bangladesh": 1,
    "other_uncategorized": 2
  }
```

### `founded`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The founding year of the company. |
| Data Type | `Integer (> 0)` |

#### Field Details

The founding year will be an integer greater than zero. If no year is found, it will be `null`.

If different sources list different founding years, we will choose the year that appears in the most sources. If multiple years appear in the same number of sources, we will use the latest year.

#### Example

JSON

```
"founded": 2015
```

### `headline`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The company’s headline summary. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

`headline` is a short description of the company, limited to 300 characters.

#### Example

JSON

```
"headline": "Your Single Source of Truth"
```

### `size`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A range representing the number of people working at the company. |
| Data Type | `Enum (String)` |

#### Field Details

The value of this field will be one of our canonical [Company Sizes](/docs/company-sizes). We derive it from the company's self-reported size on their social media profile.

For the true number of employees, use the [`employee_count`](#employee_count) field.

#### Example

JSON

```
"size": "11-50"
```

### `summary`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A description of the company. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

The company summary is a lowercase string and can contain escape characters such as `\n`. The string is limited to a maximum of 1000 characters.

#### Example

```
  "summary": "people data labs builds people data. \n\nuse our dataset
              of 1.5 billion unique person profiles to build products,
              enrich person profiles, power predictive modeling/ai,
              analysis, and more. we work with technical teams as their
              engineering focused people data partner. \n\nwe work with
              thousands of data science teams as their engineering focused
              people data partner. these include enterprises like adidas,
              ebay, and acxiom, as well as startups like madison logic,
              zoho, and workable. we are a deeply technical company, and
              are backed by two leading engineering venture capital firms
              - founders fund and 8vc.",
```

### `tags`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Tags associated with the company. |
| Data Type | `Array [String]` |

#### Field Details

Each tag is a lowercase string.

There may be tags that seem to overlap (for example: `"data"`, `"analytics"` and `"data and analytics"`). This is intentional so that it is easier to search for companies matching a tag.

#### Example

JSON

```
"tags": [
    "data",
    "people data",
    "data science",
    "artificial intelligence",
    "data and analytics",
    "machine learning",
    "analytics",
    "database",
    "software",
    "developer apis"
   ]
```

### `website`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The primary company website. |
| Data Type | `String` |

#### Field Details

This field contains the address of the primary company website associated with the record.

We standardize websites by removing `https://www.` and any additional subdomains and paths (with certain exceptions). Popular hosting platforms (like Facebook, Blogspot, Wix, etc.) will retain their subdomains and paths. For example, `samspizza.blogspot.com` or `etsy.com/sams-pizza`.

Websites using link shortening services (like Bit.ly, TinyURL, ShortURL, etc.) will appear in full.

We have a list of invalid URL items (domains, subdomains and TLDs) that we check against. We also check if an iteration of the company name appears in the website address as a simple validation.

Ideally, this is the website address that people commonly use when accessing a company's site (such as `facebook.com`) and not an alias (such as `fb.com`).

As with [Social Presence](#social-presence), we do **not** verify that the website is valid.

#### Example

JSON

```
"website": "peopledatalabs.com"
```

## Funding Data

### `funding_stages`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | All disclosed funding stages for the company. |
| Data Type | `Array [Enum (String)]` |

#### Field Details

An unordered list of all funding stages for funding events announced by the company.

This is generated from the separate events in [`funding_details.funding_type`](#funding_details).

All values in the list must be [Canonical Funding Rounds](/docs/funding-rounds). If there are multiple events tied to the same round (ex: Series A), that label will only appear once in the list.

#### Example

JSON

```
"funding_stages": [
    "series_b",
    "series_a",
    "seed"
  ]
```

### `last_funding_date`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The date of the company’s most recent funding event. |
| Data Type | [`String (Date)`](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/data-types#dates) |

#### Field Details

The date of the company’s most recent funding event. This represents the publicly disclosed date of the closing of the financing, and will be independent of any prior dates associated with that same funding round.

#### Example

JSON

```
"last_funding_date": "2021-11-16"
```

### `latest_funding_stage`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The stage of the company’s most recent funding event. |
| Data Type | `Enum (String)` |

#### Field Details

Must be one of the [Canonical Funding Rounds](/docs/funding-rounds).

#### Example

JSON

```
"latest_funding_stage": "series_b"
```

### `number_funding_rounds`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The number of funding rounds announced by the company. |
| Data Type | `Integer (> 0)` |

#### Field Details

The number of separate funding events for the company. This is the total number of events in [`funding_details`](#funding_details).

If multiple events are tied to the same funding round, they will each be counted toward the total (ex: 3 Series A events will add 3 to the total count).

#### Example

JSON

```
"number_funding_rounds": 7
```

### `total_funding_raised`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The cumulative amount raised by the company in USD. |
| Data Type | `Float (> 0)` |

#### Field Details

The cumulative amount raised by the company during all publicly disclosed funding rounds.

The value for this field is represented in USD. It is the sum of all known values from individual funding rounds (each of which is represented in $ USD using “then-current” currency exchange rates).

#### Example

JSON

```
"total_funding_raised": 55250000.0
```

## Industry Types

### `industry`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The self-reported industry of the company. |
| Data Type | `Enum (String)` |

#### Field Details

Industry is self-reported and will be one of our [Canonical Industries](/docs/industries). If no industry is found, the field will be `null`.

#### Example

JSON

```
"industry": "animation"
```

  

### `industry_v2`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Industry v2 is the self-reported industry from an expanded list of [Canonical v2 Industries](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/industries-v2). If no industry is found, the field will be `null` |
| Data Type | [`Enum (String)`](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/industries-v2) |

#### Field Details

Industry is self-reported and will be one of our [Canonical V2 Industries](/docs/industries-v2). If no industry is found, the field will be `null`.

#### Example

JSON

```
"industry": "textile manufacturing"
```

### `naics`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | An array of objects containing the industry classifications for a company according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). A company can (and frequently does) have multiple NAICS codes. |
| Data Type | `Array [Object]` |

#### Field Details

Each NAICS code associated with the company will be included in the list. For each NAICS code, we provide the actual six-digit code as well as the official description for each level of the NAICS code.

PDL uses [NAICS 2017 industry categorization](https://www.bls.gov/cew/classifications/industry/home.htm).

PDL offers self-reported NAICS industry categorizations within the company data, where this data serves as an alternative to Industry and SIC for users to categorize or segment companies. Because the data PDL publishes represents self-reported data where the industry values were selected by employees of those companies prior to the 2022 revision, we have not bulk converted to, or inferred, NAICS 2022 categories for our existing NAICS values.

A NAICS code doesn’t have to use all six digits. Any unspecified field(s) in our data will have a `null` value.

| Field | Data Type | Description |

## Social Presence

We currently include company social profiles for LinkedIn, Yellow Pages, Xing, Twitter, Facebook and Crunchbase. Any profiles that we find for the company from these sources will be added to the [`profiles`](#profiles) list.

Each social profile URL has one or more standard formats that we parse and turn into a standard PDL format for that social URL. We invalidate profiles that have non-valid company stubs (for example, `linkedin.com/in`), and we also have a blacklist of usernames that we know are invalid.

We do **not** validate if a URL is valid (that is, whether you can access it) because doing this at scale is considered a Direct Denial of Service (DDoS) attack and/or a form of crawling. This is highly discouraged! We try to mitigate invalid URLs as much as possible by using Entity Resolution (Merging) to link URLs together and then tagging the primary URL at the top level for key networks.

### `linkedin_id`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The main LinkedIn profile ID for the company based on source agreement. |

# Company Insights Fields

Premium fields presenting summaries of the employee headcount and trends, built by aggregating data from from our [Person Dataset](/docs/fields).

## Average Employee Tenure

Average employee tenure is the average number of years employees work for the company. It is represented by a floating number greater than zero and rounded to the nearest thousandth. It could skew lower if there have been a lot of recent hires.

The average is calculated using `experience.start_date` and `experience.end_date` for each employee found in our Person records.

If no start date is given or if a date only contains a year but no month, then the experience is not counted toward the average.

### `average_employee_tenure`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The average years of experience at the company. |
| Data Type | `Float (> 0)` |

#### Field Details

This insight shows the average number of years that employees at the company have worked based on `experience.start_date` and `experience.end_date`.

#### Example

JSON

```
"average_employee_tenure": 2.75
```

### `average_tenure_by_level`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The average years of experience at the company by job level. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

This insight shows the average number of years that employees at the company have worked broken out by their level at the company. The average for each level is calculated using the same logic as [`average_employee_tenure`](#average_employee_tenure).

The level names come from `experience.title.levels`, meaning they will always be one of the [Canonical Job Levels](/docs/job-title-levels).

#### Example

JSON

```
"average_tenure_by_level": {
    "entry": 0.3,
    "unpaid": 2.0,
    "senior": 6.0,
    "director": 3.0,
    "vp": 2.4,
    "training": 0.2,
    "manager": 4.0,
    "owner": 3.2,
    "partner": 2.4,
    "cxo": 8.1
  }
```

### `average_tenure_by_role`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The average years of experience at the company by job role. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

This insight shows the average number of years that employees at the company have worked broken out by their role at the company. The average for each role is calculated using the same logic as [`average_employee_tenure`](#average_employee_tenure).

The role names come from `experience.title.role`, meaning they will always be one of the [Canonical Job Roles](/docs/job-title-roles).

#### Example

JSON

```
"average_tenure_by_role": {
    "real_estate": 4.5,
    "design": 2.0,
    "trades": 3.2,
    "marketing": 0.1,
    "education": 6.5,
    "legal": 8.0,
    "customer_service": 4.0,
    "finance": 5.0,
    "public_relations": 8.1,
    "engineering": 2.1,
    "human_resources": 0.5,
    "media": 0.4,
    "sales": 0.6,
    "operations": 0.1,
    "health": 2.0
  }
```

## Employee Count Breakdowns

The count for each category will always be an integer value greater than or equal to zero.

This number may be higher or lower than a company's real employee count depending on how many false positives and false negatives we have in our data, missing and duplicate individuals, and missing information on start dates and job roles.

If no start date is given, then the experience is not counted.

For the overall employee count, see [`employee_count`](#employee_count). For the company's self-reported size, see [`size`](#size).

Note that discrepancies between the [`employee_count`](#employee_count), the most recent [`employee_count_by_month`](#employee_count_by_month), and aggregated[`employee_count_by_month_by_role`](#employee_count_by_month_by_role) and [`employee_count_by_month_by_level`](#employee_count_by_month_by_level) counts are expected. For more information about the logic used to calculate these values, see [this page](/docs/employee-count-fields).

### `employee_count_by_month`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The number of employees at the end of each month. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The total number of profiles associated with this company at the end of each month in the format `YYYY-MM`. The date range begins at the start date of the first associated employee or January 1, 2010, whichever is most recent. The final month in the range will be the last full month before the last monthly [Data Build](/docs/data-build). Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain all data up to that February.

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_count_by_month": {
    "2021-07": 84,
    "2021-08": 86,
    "2021-09": 84
  }
```

### `employee_count_by_month_by_level`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The number of employees at the end of each month, broken down by job level. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The total number of profiles associated with this company at the end of each month in the format `YYYY-MM` broken down by `experience.title.levels`. The level names will always be one of the [Canonical Job Levels](/docs/job-title-levels).

The date range begins at the start date of the first associated employee or January 1, 2010, whichever is most recent. The final month in the range will be the last full month before the last monthly [Data Build](/docs/data-build). Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain all data up to that February.

If a person changes levels within a company during the same month, they will be counted in the same month towards both levels. An individual may have more than a single level for the same experience object, in which case they will contribute towards multiple levels.

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_count_by_month_by_level": {
    "2015-03": {
      "partner": 0,
      "vp": 0,

### `employee_count_by_month_by_role`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The number of employees at the end of each month, broken down by job role. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The total number of profiles associated with this company at the end of each month in the format `YYYY-MM` broken down by `experience.title.role`. The role names will always be one of the [Canonical Job Roles](/docs/job-title-roles).

The date range begins at the start date of the first associated employee or January 1, 2010, whichever is most recent. The final month in the range will be the last full month before the last monthly [Data Build](/docs/data-build). Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain all data up to that February.

If a person changes roles with a company during the same month, they will only be counted for a single role.

Beginning in v25.0, each month will also contain an `other_uncategorized` subfield. Profiles that we have associated with the company but do not have enough information to assign a role to will be included in this field. For more information, see [Employee Count Fields](/docs/employee-count-fields).

## Employee Growth and Churn Rates

All calculation time frames are based on the month that you make the request. If you make the request in April, the three-month rate will use data from January onward.

If no start date is given, then the experience is not counted.

Additionally, if a date only contains a year but no month, it is assumed to be to be January for start dates and December (or the current month if December is in the future) for end dates.

### `employee_churn_rate`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The rate of change in employee headcount from N months prior. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

This is a representation of net employee turnover. The churn rate is rounded to four decimal points and is always greater than or equal to 0. If the company had 0 employees or did not exist at the start time for a specific window, then the churn rate is `null`.

Churn rate is calculated as `max(employee_count_n_months_ago - employee_count_current, 0)/employee_count_n_months_ago`. For example, if a company has 200 employees at the beginning of the month, and at the end of the month 100 leave and 100 remain then its churn rate = 100 / 200 = 0.5.

| Field | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| `3_month` | `Float (>= 0)` |
| `6_month` | `Float (>= 0)` |
| `12_month` | `Float (>= 0)` |
| `24_month` | `Float (>= 0)` |

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_churn_rate": {
    "3_month": 0.015,
    "6_month": 0.02,
    "12_month": 0.035,
    "24_month": 0.155
  }
```

### `employee_growth_rate`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The percentage increase in total headcount from N months prior. |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The growth rate is rounded to four decimal points and can be negative if the current number of employees is less than in the past. If the company had zero employees or did not exist at the start time for a specific window, then the growth rate is `null`.

Growth rate is calculated as `(current_employee_count / previous_employee_count) - 1`. For example, if a company has 100 employees at the beginning of the month, and at the end of the month has grown to 200 employees then its growth rate = (200 / 100) - 1 = 1.0.

| Field | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| `3_month` | `Float` |
| `6_month` | `Float` |
| `12_month` | `Float` |
| `24_month` | `Float` |

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_growth_rate": {
    "3_month": 0.0595,
    "6_month": 0.0723,
    "12_month": 0.8542,
    "24_month": 1.4722
  }

### `employee_growth_rate_12_month_by_class`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The twelve month rate of change by [Job Title Class](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/job-title-class). |
| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The 12 month growth rate of the total number of profiles associated with this company at the end of the most recent month in the format `YYYY-MM` broken down by `experience.title.class`. The role names will always be one of the [Canonical Job Title Class](/docs/job-title-class) labels. This field will also contain an `other_uncategorized` subfield that contains profiles we have associated with the company but do not have enough information to assign a role to.

The growth rate is rounded to four decimal points and can be negative if the current number of employees is less than in the past. If the company had zero employees or did not exist at the start time for a specific window, then the growth rate is `null`.

Growth rate is calculated as `(current_employee_count / previous_employee_count) - 1`. For example, if a company has 100 employees at the beginning of the month 12 months ago, and at the end of the most recent month has grown to 200 employees then its growth rate = (200 / 100) - 1 = 1.0.

The 12 month growth rate will be computed using the last full month before the last monthly Data Build. Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain the 12 month growth rate from February."

#### Example

JSON

```
"employee_growth_rate_12_month_by_class": {

The role names will always be one of the [Canonical Job Roles](/docs/job-title-roles). This field will also contain an `other_uncategorized` subfield that contains profiles we have associated with the company but do not have enough information to assign a role to.

The growth rate is rounded to four decimal points and can be negative if the current number of employees is less than in the past. If the company had zero employees or did not exist at the start time for a specific window, then the growth rate is `null`.

Growth rate is calculated as `(current_employee_count / previous_employee_count) - 1`. For example, if a company has 100 employees at the beginning of the month 12 months ago, and at the end of the most recent month has grown to 200 employees then its growth rate = (200 / 100) - 1 = 1.0.

The 12 month growth rate will be computed using the last full month before the last monthly Data Build. Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain the 12 month growth rate from February.

| Data Type | `Object` |

#### Field Details

The 12 month growth rate of the total number of profiles associated with this company at the end of the most recent month in the format `YYYY-MM` broken down by `experience.title.sub_role`. The role names will always be one of the [Canonical Job Title Subroles](/docs/job-title-subroles).

## Gross Additions and Departures

This insight shows the total number of employees that joined or left the company each month.

The count for each month will always be an integer greater than or equal to zero. The month range begins at the start date of the first associated employee or January 1, 2010, whichever is most recent. The final month in the range will be the last full month before the last monthly [Data Build](/docs/data-build). Most often this is the month before request was submitted. For example, if you make a request mid-March, the response will contain all data up to that February.

This number may be higher or lower than a company's real employee count depending on how many false positives and false negatives we have in our data, missing and duplicate individuals, and missing information on start/end dates.

If a start or end date is not given or only contains a year but no month, it is not counted. This differs from [`employee_count_by_month`](#employee_count_by_month) that assumes January if there is no month.

#### Field Details

A company's inferred revenue is an estimated range of its annual revenue in US dollars and can be used as a filter in [Company Search queries](/docs/company-search-api).

The revenue estimate is calculated using a predictive model that factors in details generated for our [Company Insights Fields](#company-insights-fields) (for example, [employee\_count\_by\_month\_by\_role](#employee_count_by_month_by_role)) as well as for other inputs that have been shown to be highly correlative.

The range will be one of our [Canonical Inferred Revenue Ranges](/docs/inferred-revenue-ranges).

#### Example

```
"inferred_revenue": "$10M-$25M"
```

## Recent Executive Changes

These insights provide details on executives that have joined or left the company in the past three months at the time you make the request.

There is no limit on the number of executives that can be in either list. To determine if someone is an executive, we check if their `experience.title.levels` in the company matches `CXO`, `owner` or `VP`. If no level is specified, then the experience is not counted.

If a start or end date is not given for an executive, then the experience is not counted. If the date only contains a year, the month is assumed to be January.

## Top Next and Previous Employers

The top ten next and previous companies employees are broken down by job role.

Companies are listed using their [PDL Company ID](#id).

The first list of companies will be under the `"all"` key. This represents the top 10 companies for any role.

The roles are based on the employee’s role at the company queried. Each role listed in the break down will come from the [Canonical Job Roles](/docs/job-title-roles).

If no start date is given or no role exists, then the experience is not counted.

If there are fewer than ten next/previous employers for a role, it will return as many as there are.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/data-updates

We update our data consistently to make iterative improvements, add new sources and fields, and ensure our fields stay up-to-date.

# Update Frequency

Depending on how our customers access our data, our update frequency changes. For more information or questions, please reach out to your Customer Success team.

## Data Updates

| Data Access Type | Monthly | Quarterly |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API | ✅ | ❌ |
| Data License Flat Files | ✅ | ✅ |

As of the [May 2024 Release (v26.1)](/changelog/may-2024-release-announcement-v26-1), we offer [Delta Files](/docs/delta-file-deliveries) as a streamlined delivery format.

> 💡
>
> ### Need faster updates?
>
> Our goal is to push towards faster and faster updates and develop new mechanisms for updating flat files. Visit our [public roadmap](https://feedback.peopledatalabs.com) to provide us with feedback on new mechanisms for data updates for your ideal workflow.

## Product Releases

### Major Changes: **Quarterly**

Major breaking changes to our products such as new data fields, new canonicalized field values, new APIs, or significant changes to our existing APIs will be rolled out quarterly and documented in our [Release Notes](/docs/changelog).

### Minor Bug Fixes & Improvements: **Monthly**

Data updates (including new data sources), bug fixes, and improvements will be rolled out monthly. These updates will only be available through our APIs.

### Beta Fields & New Products: **Monthly**

New products and field bundles will be rolled out monthly on an invite-only basis. We won’t be rolling out major changes that impact the wider customer base in our monthly releases. As such, we will not be providing monthly release notes at this time. However, you can track iterative product releases in our [public roadmap](https://feedback.peopledatalabs.com/) by voting on cards to subscribe to updates.

# Data Goals

1. To ensure that we have current job title, company, and location information for as many profiles as possible.

* While we value the accuracy of all fields, we value the accuracy of these fields the most, as they provide the most flexible utilization across all use cases.
* The [`job_last_verified`](/docs/fields#job_last_verified) and [`location_last_updated`](/docs/fields#location_last_updated) fields indicate when our "current" job and location data last appeared in a data source.

2. To increase the total volume of data through our [Data Union](/docs/data-sources).

* By increasing the number of values we have in each field, we can improve match rates and the value of each profile to the end user.
* Our most highly-valued data partners provide linkages that cannot be found elsewhere. By taking advantage of these, we are often able to merge what would be multiple "sides" of our data together.
* Adding new data fields allows our customers to power new products and create new features. We typically aim to have relatively strong coverage of a new field before we add it to the production data. However, some fields are valued enough that we provide them as "restricted" fields to our license customers and don't expose them in the APIs.

3. To improve our [data build process](/docs/data-build).

* While we are relatively strict with our merging logic, finding new ways to increase the number of profiles that we merge without creating new errors allows us to increase the total volume of data without needing to acquire new sources of linkages.
* Improved standardization results in cleaner profiles with better field-level de-duplication. Improved standardization also allows us to successfully merge more profiles.

# Communicating Updates

The `data_version` field in API [responses](/docs/response) reflect the current version.

Our goal is to make persistence commitments regarding how each field will evolve between data releases. We aim to do this in order to help our customers build applications around our data that are sustainable. We will announce any possible breaking changes within 90 days in advance of any release.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/employee-count-fields

Our [Company Schema](/docs/company-schema) contains many different fields to represent the number of employees associated with the company record. These fields are calculated using different methods, which can result in different counts for the same company.

As of [v25.0](/changelog/january-2024-release-notes-v25#insights-logic), we've made some improvements to keep counts consistent across the following fields:

* [`employee_count`](/docs/company-schema#employee_count)
* Sum of values for [`employee_count_by_country`](/docs/company-schema#employee_count_by_country)
* The last month in [`employee_count_by_month`](/docs/company-schema#employee_count_by_month)
* Sum of values in the last month in [`employee_count_by_month_by_role`](/docs/company-schema#employee_count_by_month_by_role)

There can still be some discrepancies, the most common are explained below.

**[`size`](/docs/company-schema#size)Field**  
This information comes from a **user-selected** dropdown value obtained from the company’s primary social media profile, such as LinkedIn or Facebook. Sometimes this range is far from the real count of employees, however the function of this field is to preserve the raw selected value as selected on those platforms.

  

**Multiple Job Levels**  
The [`employee_count_by_month_by_level`](/docs/company-schema#employee_count_by_month_by_level) field presents a summary of the [`job_title_levels`](/docs/fields#job_title_levels), which is itself a “one-to-many” field highlighting the seniority levels for a person’s job title. If a person role has multiple levels (ex: the job title “founder and ceo” would have tags for both "cxo" and "owner"), that person is counted multiple times (once for each level).

  

**Comparisons to LinkedIn Employee Counts**  
Because we generate our counts bottom-up as aggregations of the underlying person record data associated with company record, you can expect a slight discrepancy between PDL’s employee counts and those represented on LinkedIn company pages.

Specifically, we’ve incorporated additional profile cleaning and data validation steps that we believe make our counts more accurate representations of the true workforces of represented companies. For example, favorable discrepancies can emerge from a reduced rate of person profile and work experience duplication, stricter fuzzy matching on work experience to corresponding canonical companies, and separate accounting for subsidiary company records for corporate conglomerates.

## Overview

The Skill Enrichment API lets you enrich data on a skill by performing a one-to-one match of this skill with those included in our [Skill](/docs/skill-schema) Dataset. Once matched, you can search for profiles with less context. For example, instead of explicitly searching for "engineers who know spark, mapreduce or hadoop" you can search for "engineers who know spark or have similar skills."

**Note**: Our current Skill Dataset only contains skills seen at least 250 times across our global resume data.

## Expected Usage

This API functions primarily as a support for our [Person Search API](/docs/person-search-api). Once you enhance a skill, you can use the returned information in your Person Search query to find better matches in our Person Dataset.

We expect the flow for using the Skill Enrichment and Person Search APIs to broadly follow one of the two patterns shown in the diagrams below:

Flow 1: Using the Skill Enrichment API to search for people with similar skills.



Flow 2: Using the Skill Enrichment API to search for people with job titles relevant to the skill.

## What is the difference between the various Person APIs?

See [this section](/docs/person-endpoints#the-differences-between-our-person-related-apis) for a detailed breakdown of the differences between our Person APIs.

## If I submit a blank parameter in the request will the results be affected? e.g. profile=linkedin.com/in/seanthorne&name=Sean Thorne&company=

Submitting a blank value for a parameter will not affect the quality of the results. Any parameter with an empty value will not be considered when providing you with a match.

## Will I be charged for retrieving the same profile multiple times?

Yes. PDL will charge for the retrieval of the same profile.

**Example**  
You enrich for a profile with the LinkedIn URL: linkedin.com/in/linfluencer. A day later you enrich a profile with the same LinkedIn URL. You will be charged two credits, one for each successful response.

To handle for situations demonstrated in the above example , PDL recommends duplicate call detection. You can use methods like unique key constraints. For example, you can hash the request, storing the hash, and check for a duplicate call before sending it to the API.

## Endpoints

URLs for our Sandbox APIs follow this structure: `https://sandbox.api.peopledatalabs.com/<path>`, where `<path>` is one of the following:

| API | Sandbox Endpoint Path |
| --- | --- |
| [Person Enrichment](/docs/reference-person-enrichment-api#endpoint) | `v5/person/enrich` |

| [Company Enrichment](/docs/reference-company-enrichment-api) | `v5/company/enrich` |
| [Company Search](/docs/reference-company-search-api) | `v5/company/search` |

For example, the endpoint for the Sandbox Person Enrichment API is `https://sandbox.api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich`.

## SDK Usage

To access the Sandbox API endpoints within our SDKs, use any of the following language-specific strategies:

Python3 SDKJavaScriptRubyGo

```
# Set sandbox to True when creating a client
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
    # Use Sandbox API
    sandbox=True,
)
```

```
// Set sandbox to true in the parameters JSON object
const params = {
  email: "irussell@example.org",
  min_likelihood: 6,
  // Use Sandbox API
  sandbox: true
}
```

```
# Use Sandbox API
Peopledatalabs.sandbox = true
```

```
// Include extra imports
import (
    pdl "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go"
    "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go/api"
    pdlmodel "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go/model"
)

// Set Sandbox to true in ClientOptions() when creating a client
client := pdl.New(apiKey,
                      api.ClientOptions(func(c *api.Client) {
                                    c.Sandbox = true
                      }))
```

See [Sandbox examples](/docs/sandbox-apis-examples) for specific usage.

## Billing and Access

The Sandbox APIs are free endpoints and do not consume credits. All plans have access.

## Rate Limiting

The default rate limit for all customers is five calls per minute.

## Response Data Structure

The response from the Person Enrichment API will be in this format:

JSON

```
{
    "status": 200,
    "likelihood": 10,
    "data":  {
            "id": "qEnOZ5Oh0poWnQ1luFBfVw_0000",
            "full_name": "sean thorne",
            ...
     }
}
```

See [Example Person Record](/docs/example-record) for a full example of the fields included in the `data` object.

## Response Fields

### `data.*`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Object` | The matched profile record that contains fields from our [Person Schema](/docs/fields). Any fields in the profile record that do not contain any data will have a `null` value. |

The `data` object contains the entire [PDL profile](/docs/fields) for the person that matches the Enrichment API request. Any profile field that we do not have data for will have a `null` value.

  

### `status`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The [API response code](/docs/errors). |

  

### `likelihood`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | How confident we are that the returned profile is the same as the person you requested. Will be an integer between `1` and `10`.  You can control the minimum likelihood score that a response must have in order to count as a match by setting the [`min_likelihood` parameter](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api#min_likelihood) in the API request. |

We assign every match that the API finds during the enrichment process a likelihood score, to represent our confidence that the profile returned is the same as the profile requested. A score of `1` represents a very low confidence level while a score of `10` represents the highest degree of confidence. The likelihood score is logarithmic, so a response that returns a likelihood score of `2` will have roughly a 10-30% chance of being the person requested.

For example, enriching "John Smith" in "New York" is too vague for us to confidently say which of our profiles is the exact John Smith that you requested. However, if you were to attach an email, phone number, and street address to the request and they matched our data, we would be highly confident that we are returning the correct John Smith.

  

### `matched`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Array (String)` | Every query input from the request that matched this profile.   * \*IMPORTANT:\*\* This field will only be included in the response if the [`include_if_matched` flag](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api#include_if_matched) is set to `true`. |

See the [`include_if_matched` input parameter](/docs/input-parameters-person-enrichment-api#include_if_matched) for more details.

>
> For more information, please see our [April 2025 Release Notes (v30.0)](/changelog/april-2025-release-notes-v300).

## Getting Started

In order to use our Skill Enrichment API, you must have an active API key. You can look up your API key by logging into our [self-serve dashboard](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/main/api-keys) and going to the **API Keys** section.

> 👍
>
> ### Need an API Key?
>
> If you don't have an API key, you can easily create one by [signing up](https://peopledatalabs.com/signup) for a self-serve account. Check out our [Self-Serve Quickstart Guide](https://blog.peopledatalabs.com/post/self-signup-api-quickstart), which walks you through the sign-up process as well as shows you how to use the self-serve API dashboard.

## Simple Example

As mentioned in the [Overview](/docs/skill-enrichment-api#overview), the Skill Enrichment API is a means of performing a one-to-one match of a skill with those included in our [Skill](/docs/skill-schema) Dataset. In order to use the Skill Enrichment API, **you will need the[skill](/docs/input-parameters-skill-enrichment-api#skill) that you want to look up**.

Here's a quick example that demonstrates retrieving a record with a `skill` of `ai`:

Python3 SDKcURLJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
)

# Create a parameters JSON object
QUERY_STRING = {"skill": "ai"}

# Pass the parameters object to the Skill Enrichment API
response = CLIENT.skill(**QUERY_STRING)

# Print the API response
print(response.text)
```

```
curl -X GET -G \
  'https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/skill/enrich' \
  -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR API KEY' \
  --data-urlencode 'skill=ai'
```

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLJSClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: "YOUR API KEY" });

// Create a parameters JSON object
const queryString = {skill: "ai"}

// Pass the parameters object to the Skill API
PDLJSClient.skill(queryString).then((data) => {
    // Print the API response
    console.log(data);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});
```

```
# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-ruby
require 'peopledatalabs'

# Set your API key
Peopledatalabs.api_key = 'YOUR API KEY'

# Pass parameters to the Skill API
response = Peopledatalabs::Skill.retrieve("skill": "ai")

# Print the API response
puts response
```

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "context"
)

// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go
import (
    pdl "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go"
    pdlmodel "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go/model"
)

func main() {
    // Set your API key
    apiKey := "YOUR API KEY"
    // Set API key as environmental variable
    // apiKey := os.Getenv("API_KEY")

    // Create a client, specifying your API key
    client := pdl.New(apiKey)
    
    // Create a parameters JSON object
    queryString := pdlmodel.SkillBaseParams{Skill: "ai"}
    
    params := pdlmodel.SkillParams{
        SkillBaseParams: queryString,
    }
    
    // Pass the parameters object to the Skill API
    response, err := client.Skill(context.Background(), params)
    // Check for successful response
    if err == nil {
        // Print the API response
        fmt.Println(response)
    }  
}
```

```
import requests

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY"

# Set the Skill Enrichment API URL
PDL_URL = "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/skill/enrich"

# Create a parameters JSON object
QUERY_STRING = {"skill": "ai"}

# Set headers
HEADERS = {
    'accept': "application/json",
    'content-type': "application/json",
    'x-api-key': API_KEY
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Skill Enrichment API
response = requests.request("GET", PDL_URL, headers=HEADERS, params=QUERY_STRING)

# Print the API response
print(response.text)
```

The API returns a record like the one below if the `skill` that you passed it exists in our dataset:

JSON

```
{
  "cleaned_skill": "ai",
  "similar_skills": [
    "machine learning",
    "artificial intelligence",
    "deep learning",
    "data science",
    "iot"
  ],
  "relevant_job_titles": [
    "data scientist",

    "senior data scientist",
    "chief technology officer",
    "senior software engineer"
  ]
}
```

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/identify-api

## Overview

The Person Identify API allows you to use broad search inputs to retrieve multiple records from our person dataset. In particular, this endpoint enables functionality such as searching through a single identifying attribute, such as name, email, phone number, company, school or location, in addition to using any combination of these attributes [and more](/docs/reference-person-identify-api#input-parameters). The API then scores and sorts all matching records that it returns based on the [strength of their association with the input parameters](/docs/output-response-person-identify-api#matchesmatch_score).

> 📘
>
> ### How Does the Person Identify API Compare with Other Person-Related Endpoints?
>
> See our [Introduction](/docs/introduction#the-differences-between-our-person-related-apis) for a detailed breakdown regarding the differences between the Person Identify API and our other person-related products.

## Use Cases

A key use case for this endpoint is building comprehensive profiles for specific individuals, such as in the areas of:

* Investigations and forensics
* Fraud risk modeling
* Identity modeling for customer onboarding and other [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) applications

## How it Works

At a high level, the Person Identify API works as follows:

1. You specify some characteristics about the identity that you are interested in and pass these as [input parameters](/docs/identify-api-input-parameters) to the API.
2. The API [cleans](/docs/cleaner-apis) the input parameter values and searches our Person Dataset for matching profiles using fuzzy-matching logic.
3. The API returns up to 20 of the the best matching profiles in its response while ranking them by their [match score](/docs/identify-api-output-response#matchesmatch_score).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/datasets

## Terminology

**Person (All) Dataset**: Our collection of every profile record that we have published and made available for use. These records can contain null values for any of their fields.

**Field**: The attributes associated with each record in our dataset, as listed in the [Person Schema](/docs/fields). Each record in our Person Dataset contains all the fields in the Person Schema. However, in general, these records can have null values for their fields.

**Dataset**: A subset of our Person Dataset that contains every record with non-null value for a specific field. For example, our [Email Dataset](/docs/datasets#email-slice) contains every record from our Person Dataset with at least one non-null email address.

## Description

We refer to our full dataset of person profiles as our **Person Dataset** or our **All Dataset**. This dataset contains every person record that we have been able to confidently produce through our [data ingestion and build process](/docs/data-build). However, records in our dataset are not guaranteed to have every **field** populated, and, in general, can contain null values. This is due to our high confidence requirement for merging and inferring missing field values and that we want to present the data as authentically as possible with a minimal amount of modification.

> 📘
>
> ### Null Values and Frankenstein Profiles
>
> Given the volume of data we take in, we often have many raw records with data on the same person. While we spend significant engineering resources working on linkages, it's not unusual to end up with 3-4 profiles of disparate information that relate to the same person.
>
> While we could link these together (for example, based on name), this would create many false positive linkages. We call these **Frankenstein profiles**, where data on multiple people has been combined, making that record unusable, even application-breaking. Frankenstein profiles are bad, and we are extremely vigilant to the presence of them in our datasets.

In opting to have a strict linkage algorithm in our [data build process](/docs/data-build), we also decided to define multiple use-case-specific subsets of the All Dataset data called Datasets. For example, our Email Dataset is a subset of our All Dataset containing every record that has a non-null email address.

This approach means that we are not forced to merge and infer missing information where we have low confidence in the original data while also helping to ensure a lower rate of duplication in the data as compared to using the All Dataset. Customers interested accessing the unmerged records still have the option do so through using the All Dataset instead of one of subset datasets.

# Data Ingestion Schemas

## Preset Ingestion Schemas

We provide up-to-date ingestion schemas in our [public S3 bucket]('https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/pdl-prod-schema/') with each release.)

| Name | Description | S3 Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Company | All [non-premium](/docs/company-stats) Company Data fields | <https://pdl-prod-schema.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33.1/schemas/company_schema.json> |
| Location | Location fields in [Location Cleaner API](/docs/cleaner-apis-reference#location-cleaner-api-locationclean-1) responses | <https://pdl-prod-schema.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33.1/schemas/location_schema.json> |
| Person (Default) | All [non-premium](/docs/stats) Person Data fields | <https://pdl-prod-schema.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33.1/schemas/person_defaults_schema.json> |
| Person (Full) | All Person Data fields | <https://pdl-prod-schema.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33.1/schemas/person_full_schema.json> |

### Snowflake Schemas

> ❄️
>
> Snowflake users can find our standard schemas [here](/docs/data-delivery-using-snowflake#standard-schemas)

  

## Generate Custom Ingestion Schemas

If you have a field combination not represented in a preset schema OR if you'd prefer to build your own, you will need to generate your JSON schema for your data ingestion process.

There are many tools available that can quickly do this. For example, the Python package [GenSON](https://github.com/wolverdude/genson/) can generate a schema from one or multiple files like this:

Shell

```
$ pip install genson

# source file > target file
$ genson -d 'newline' my-pdl-data-file > my_schema.json
```

## Overview

Clean input data can make a big difference when it comes to retrieving the best results from your queries. With our Cleaner APIs, you can clean the company, location and school data that you employ in your API queries. We use these same APIs for standardizing our data as part of our [Data Build Process](/docs/data-build).

## Examples of Location Cleaning Using the Location Cleaner API:

| Raw Location Name | Cleaned Location Name |
| --- | --- |
| "San Francisco" | `san francisco, california, united states` |
| "dc" | `washington, district of columbia, united states` |
| "USA" | `united states` |
| "London" | `london, greater london, united kingdom` |

In short, the Cleaner APIs let you:

* Clean company, school and location names before using them with our Search APIs.
* Easily clean and standardize your own raw data for your own use.

## What's Next

Please check out the following pages for more information on the Cleaner APIs:

| Page | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart-cleaner-apis) | A quick hands-on introduction to the APIs with simple code examples. |
| [Reference](/docs/cleaner-apis-reference) | Detailed descriptions of the technical specifications and usage constraints. |
| [Input Parameters](/docs/input-parameters-cleaner-apis) | In-depth explanations of the input parameters that the APIs support. |
| [Output Responses](/docs/output-response-cleaner-apis) | In-depth explanations of the output response objects that the APIs return. |
| [Examples](/docs/examples-cleaner-apis) | A collection of functional code examples and walkthroughs that illustrate various use cases and applications of the APIs. |
| [FAQs](/docs/faqs-cleaner-apis) | Answers to commonly asked questions and other good-to-know information. |

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/cleaner-apis-reference

We designed the Cleaner APIs to clean your company, school and location data so that you can better query our person data. We use these same cleaners for standardizing our data as part of our [Data Build Process](/docs/data-build).

## Endpoints

The endpoints for the Cleaner APIs are:

Company: `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/clean`  
Location: `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/location/clean`  
School: `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/school/clean`

## Billing and Access

The Cleaner APIs are public and we make them available by default to all customers.

## Rate Limiting

The standard rate limit is 10 per minute, and we have a standard total limit of 10,000 per month that we provide free of charge. To increase your monthly limit above 10,000, reach out to your Data Consultant or Customer Success Manager.

## Input Parameters

Each of the three Cleaner API endpoints supports a different set of input parameters, which we've described in the tables below:

> 📘
>
> ### For More Details, See [Input Parameters - Cleaner APIs](/docs/input-parameters-cleaner-apis)
>
> You can also click on the individual parameter names in the table below to view more information on them.

## Will I be charged for retrieving the same profile multiple times?

Yes. PDL will charge for the retrieval of the same profile.

**Example**  
You enrich for a profile with the LinkedIn URL: linkedin.com/company/peopledatalabs. A day later you enrich a profile with the same LinkedIn URL. You will be charged two credits, one for each successful response.

To handle for situations demonstrated in the above example , PDL recommends duplicate call detection. You can use methods like unique key constraints. For example, you can hash the request, storing the hash, and check for a duplicate call before sending it to the API.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api

## Required Parameters

You **must** provide either the [`query`](#query) or the [`sql`](#sql) parameter (but not both) to receive a successful response. We recommend using the Elasticsearch `query` parameter for most use cases.

When you execute an API request, the query runs directly against our [Person Dataset](/docs/stats) without any cleaning or preprocessing. This means that you have a *lot* of freedom to explore the dataset and return the perfect records for your particular use case. It also means that you will need to understand the available fields to make successful queries.

Use the field descriptions on the [Person Schema](/docs/fields) and the underlying [Elasticsearch Mapping](/docs/elasticsearch-mapping) to help write better queries.

To help you identify how to best query for specific sub-entities (schools, companies, and locations), we offer a suite of [Cleaner APIs](/docs/cleaner-apis).

You can also use our [API Playground](https://dashboard.peopledatalabs.com/tools/api-playground) (accessible with a free PDL account) to help write and test queries for our Search APIs.

### `api_key`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | Your secret API key. |  |  |

Your API Key **must** be included in either the request header or the `api_key` parameter. For more information about request authentication, see the [Authentication](/docs/authentication) page.

---

## Optional Parameters

### `query`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Object` | An [Elasticsearch (v7.7) query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl.html) involving our [person fields](/docs/fields). \n \nSee our underlying [Elasticsearch Mapping](/docs/elasticsearch-mapping) for reference. | `"query": "term": "job_company_name": "people data labs"` |

#### **Elasticsearch Query Limitations**

The `query` value should align directly with the [Elasticsearch DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl.html).

We accept the following Elasticsearch query types:

* [term](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-term-query.html)
* [terms](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-terms-query.html)
* [exists](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-exists-query.html)
* [bool](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-bool-query.html)
* [match](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-match-query.html)
* [range](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-range-query.html)
* [match\_phrase](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-match-query-phrase.html)
* [wildcard](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-wildcard-query.html)
* [prefix](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-prefix-query.html)
* [match\_all](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-match-all-query.html)

We've disabled most specialized options, such as boosting and custom scoring, and we do not allow aggregations.

Any array in a query (such as a `terms` array) will have a hard limit of 1000 elements. If a request goes over this limit, it will fail.

### `sql`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | A SQL query of the format: `SELECT * FROM person WHERE XXX`, where XXX is a standard SQL boolean query involving our [person fields](/docs/fields). | `SELECT * FROM person WHERE job_company_name='people data labs'` |

#### **SQL Query Limitations**

We execute SQL queries using [Elasticsearch SQL](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-sql).

We accept any SQL query that translates to the [above Elasticsearch query types](#elasticsearch-query-limitations) through the [ES SQL translate API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/sql-translate.html).

We will ignore any use of column selections or the `LIMIT` keyword.

We limit the number of wildcard terms (using `LIKE` with `%`) to 20 per request. If a request goes over this limit, it will fail.

You must use subfields rather than top-level fields when making SQL queries. For example, `SELECT * FROM person WHERE experience IS NOT NULL` will fail but `SELECT * FROM person WHERE experience.title.name IS NOT NULL` will behave as expected.

### `size`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The maximum number of matched records to return for this query if they exist. Must be between `1` and `100`. | `1` | `100` |

### `scroll_token`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | Each search API response returns a `scroll_token`. Include it in the next request to fetch the next `size` matching records. |  | `104$14.278746` |

A `scroll_token` returns in every [Person Search API response](/docs/output-response-person-search-api#scroll_token) and serves as a placeholder or bookmark for the last record received. For queries with more results than can fit in a single API response (see the [`size`](#size) field), use the `scroll_token` to get the next batch of results.

For example, if you send a query to the Person Search API that has 10,000 matches, you will need multiple API calls to retrieve all the records. The `scroll_token` represents how far along you are in that list of records.

Generally, the way to use `scroll_token` is:

1. Send a query to the Person Search API.
2. Get a response back containing one batch of records as well as a `scroll_token` response value (if you have already retrieved all the available records in this batch, then the `scroll_token` value will be `null`).
3. Use the same query from Step 1 and the `scroll_token` you just received to make another request to the Person Search API.
4. Get another response back with the next batch of records and a new `scroll_token` value.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have received the desired number of records or until you receive a 404 status code because pagination is complete and the `scroll_token` key is missing from the response.

For a detailed working example of this process, see the following code example: [Bulk Retrieval](/docs/examples-person-search-api#bulk-retrieval).

### `dataset`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Enum (String)` | Specifies which [dataset(s)](/docs/datasets#list-of-slice-datasets) the API should search against. | `resume` | `all` |

You can input multiple datasets by separating each with a comma.

Valid dataset names are:

* `all`
* `resume`
* `email`
* `phone`
* `mobile_phone`
* `street_address`
* `consumer_social`
* `developer`

See [Person Stats](/docs/datasets) for details about each dataset.

You can exclude dataset(s) by using `-` as the first character. Entering `-` will exclude all of the comma-separated datasets following the character and needs to be entered only once. For example, `"all,-phone,consumer_social"` will include search results from every dataset except the phone and consumer\_social datasets.

### `titlecase`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | All text in API responses returns as lowercase by default. Setting `titlecase` to `true` will titlecase any records returned instead. | `false` | `true` |

### `data_include`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | A comma-separated string of fields that you want the response to include. |  | `"full_name,emails.address"` |

### `pretty`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | Whether the output should have [human-readable](http://jsonprettyprint.net/) indentation. | `false` | `true` |

## The Differences Between Our Person-Related APIs

We offer multiple person-related APIs, so how are they different? Here's a summary of each:

**Person Enrichment**: Finds the single best profile matching certain attributes about a particular person.

**Person Search**: Finds all the profiles for any number of persons that satisfy some search criteria.

**Person Identify**: Finds the best selection of profiles associated with a particular set of attributes for a person or related persons.

Here's a table that summarizes some of the key differences:

|  | Person Enrichment | Person Identify | Person Search |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Matching Type** | 1:1 | 1:Many | 1:Many |
| **Input Cleaning** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Supported Query Parameters** | Only supported inputs, which must be uniquely identifying | Only supported inputs, which do not need to be uniquely identifying | Anything in the Person Schema |
| **Number of Profiles per Unique Query** | 1 | Up to 20 | No limit |
| **Sorting of Returned Profiles** | N/A - only the single best-matched profile is returned | Sorted by match score | Sorted by profile completeness |

The key takeaway is that the **Person Identify API exists between our Person Enrichment and Search APIs** in terms of functionality.

Compared to the Person Enrichment API, which returns a single record for a single person, the **Person Identify API supports broader search inputs and returns multiple strongly-related profiles**. This means that the Person Identify API is ideal for situations in which you do not have enough information to uniquely resolve a person and are interested in recovering highly-probable candidates. The Person Enrichment API is better suited to targeted enrichment when you have enough uniquely-identifying information.

Compared to the Person Search API, the **Person Identify API has standardized input parameters and provides a match score for each returned profile.** This means that you can use the Person Identify API to recover a focused selection of highly related profiles, unlike the Person Search API, which will return a potentially large demographic cross-section of our Person Dataset with more loosely-related profiles.

## [Person Enrichment API](/docs/person-enrichment-api)

You can use the Person Enrichment API to enrich data on a person:

Python3 SDKcURLJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
import json

# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
)

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
    "profile": ["linkedin.com/in/seanthorne"]
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
json_response = CLIENT.person.enrichment(**PARAMS).json()

# Print the API response in JSON format
print(json_response)
```

```
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich?api_key=xxxx&profile=linkedin.com/in/seanthorne'
```

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLJSClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: "YOUR API KEY" });

// Create a parameters JSON object
const params = {
  profile: "http://linkedin.com/in/seanthorne"
}

// Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
PDLJSClient.person.enrichment(params).then((jsonResponse) => {
  // Print the API response in JSON format
  console.log(jsonResponse);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
```

```
require 'json'

# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-ruby
require 'peopledatalabs'

# Set your API key
Peopledatalabs.api_key = 'YOUR API KEY'

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
    profile: ['linkedin.com/in/seanthorne']
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
json_response = Peopledatalabs::Enrichment.person(params: PARAMS)

# Print the API response in JSON format
puts JSON.dump(json_response)
```

```
package main

import (

```

## [Bulk Person Enrichment API](/docs/bulk-enrichment-api)

We also provide a Bulk Person Enrichment API, which allows you to enrich 1-100 persons in a single request (recommended for high-volume usage):

Python3 SDKcURLJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
import json

# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
)

# Create an array of parameters JSON objects
DATA = {"requests": [{"params": {"profile": ["linkedin.com/in/seanthorne"]}}]}

# Pass the bulk parameters object to the Bulk Person Enrichment API
json_response = CLIENT.person.bulk(**DATA).json()

# Print the API response in JSON format
print(json_response)
```

```
curl -X POST "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/bulk" -H 'X-Api-Key: xxxx' 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
    "requests": [
    	{
    		"params": {
    			"profile": ["linkedin.com/in/seanthorne"]
    		}
    	}
    ]
}
```

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLJSClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: "YOUR API KEY" });

// Create an array of parameters JSON objects
const data = {
  requests: [

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api

## Required Parameters

You **must** provide either the [`query`](#query) or the [`sql`](#sql) parameter (but not both) to receive a successful response. We recommend using the Elasticsearch `query` parameter for most use cases.

When you execute an API request, the query runs directly against our [Company Dataset](/docs/company-stats) without any cleaning or preprocessing. This means that you have a *lot* of freedom to explore the dataset and return the perfect records for your particular use case. It also means that you will need to understand the available fields to make successful queries.

Use the field descriptions on the [Company Schema](/docs/company-schema) and the underlying [Elasticsearch Mapping](/docs/elasticsearch-mapping-company) to help write better queries.

To help you identify how to best query for specific sub-entities (schools, companies, and locations), we offer a suite of [Cleaner APIs](/docs/cleaner-apis).

You can also use our [API Playground](https://dashboard.peopledatalabs.com/tools/api-playground) (accessible with a free PDL account) to help write and test queries for our Search APIs.

### `api_key`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | Your secret API key. |  |  |

Your API Key **must** be included in either the request header or the `api_key` parameter. For more information about request authentication, see the [Authentication](/docs/authentication) page.

---

## Optional Parameters

### `query`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Object` | An [Elasticsearch (v7.7) query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl.html) involving our company fields.   See our underlying [Elasticsearch Mapping](/docs/elasticsearch-mapping-company) for reference. | `"query": {"term": {"name": "people data labs"}}"` |

#### **Elasticsearch Query Limitations**

We accept the following Elasticsearch query types:

* [term](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-term-query.html)
* [terms](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-terms-query.html)
* [exists](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-exists-query.html)
* [bool](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-bool-query.html)
* [match](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-match-query.html)
* [range](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-range-query.html)
* [match\_phrase](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-match-query-phrase.html)
* [wildcard](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-wildcard-query.html)
* [prefix](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-prefix-query.html)
* [match\_all](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl-match-all-query.html)

We've disabled most specialized options, such as boosting and custom scoring, and we do not allow aggregations.

Any array in a query (such as a `terms` array) will have a hard limit of 100 elements. If a request goes over this limit, it will fail.

### `sql`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | An SQL query of the format: `SELECT * FROM company WHERE XXX`, where XXX is a standard SQL boolean query involving our [company fields](/docs/company-schema). | `SELECT * FROM company WHERE name='people data labs'` |

#### **SQL Query Limitations**

We execute SQL queries using [Elasticsearch SQL](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-sql).

We accept any SQL query that translates to the [above Elasticsearch query types](#elasticsearch-query-limitations) through the [ES SQL translate API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/sql-translate.html).

We will ignore any use of column selections or the `LIMIT` keyword.

We limit the number of wildcard terms (using `LIKE` with `%`) to 20 per request. If a request goes over this limit, it will fail.

### `size`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The maximum number of matched records to return for this query if they exist. Must be between `1` and `100`. | `1` | `100` |

### `scroll_token`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | Each search API response returns a `scroll_token`. Include it in the next request to fetch the next `size` matching records. |  | `104$14.278746` |

A `scroll_token` returns in every [Company Search API response](/docs/output-response-company-search-api#scroll_token) and serves as a placeholder or bookmark for the last record received. For queries with more results than can fit in a single API response (see the [`size`](#size) field), use the `scroll_token` to get the next batch of results.

For example, if you send a query to the Company Search API that has 10,000 matches, you will need multiple API calls to retrieve all the records. The `scroll_token` represents how far along you are in that list of records.

Generally, the way to use `scroll_token` is:

1. Send a query to the Company Search API.
2. Get a response back containing one batch of records as well as a `scroll_token` response value (if you have already retrieved all the available records in this batch, then the `scroll_token` value will be `null`).
3. Use the same query from Step 1 and the `scroll_token` you just received to make another request to the Company Search API.
4. Get another response back with the next batch of records and a new `scroll_token` value.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have received the desired number of records or until you receive a 404 status code because pagination is complete and the `scroll_token` key is missing from the response.

For a detailed working example of this process, see the following code example: [Bulk Retrieval](/docs/examples-company-search-api#bulk-retrieval).

### `titlecase`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | All text in API responses returns as lowercase by default. Setting `titlecase` to `true` will titlecase any records returned instead. | `false` | `true` |

### `pretty`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | Whether the output should have [human-readable](http://jsonprettyprint.net/) indentation. | `false` | `true` |

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/persistent-ids

Persistent IDs allow for a significantly easier ingestion of new releases for our license customers. It provides for faster updates, a better understanding of how our dataset changes between builds and for collaboration between our license customers and products.

## Goals

We created our persistent ID solution to do the following:

1. Maintain IDs across builds for the great majority of records.
2. Provide metadata on a lineage of ID movement from one release to the next.

## How do IDs persist?

We built each production record in our dataset from many raw input source records. We further generate a record ID for each raw input record as it enters our ingestion pipeline. We then merge these records at some point into clusters of raw records that make up our final person records. Finally, we generate our persistent IDs by taking the oldest and most fundamental raw record that contributes to the final record in the cluster. This means that our **highest confidence** sources, which are the bedrock of our data, are contributing the majority of our IDs.

The only case in which an ID would disappear from our data would be if we removed a bedrock source, which happens very rarely and will continue to happen increasingly rarely over time.

## For License Customers

Please consult our [ID changelog](/docs/id-changelog) to learn more about how this impacts your deliveries.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/autocomplete-api

## Overview

The Autocomplete API allows you to get suggestions for Search API query values along with the number of available records for each suggestion. For example, `schools starting with "harv"`.

This API provides access to our [canonicalized datasets](/docs/canonical-data) and is meant for use in conjunction with the Person and Company Search APIs as a way of previewing what records are available before retrieving them. The Autocomplete API currently supports completion for the following field values:

* `class`: Job Classes
* `company`: Company Names
* `country`: Country Names
* `industry`: Industries
* `location`: Location Names
* `major`: Educational Majors (Field of Study)
* `region`: Region Name (for example, states for the US)
* `role`: Job Roles
* `sub_role`: Job Sub Roles
* `school`: School Names
* `skill`: Skills
* `title`: Job Titles
* `website`: Company Websites

The Autocomplete API powers the above dropdown list on the backend.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/data-sources

People Data Labs has thousands of data sources that enhance our person data and our ancillary canonical location, school and company datasets. These sources fall into two categories: our proprietary sources and our public data sources.

## Proprietary Sources

Sources of our proprietary data warrant their data is fully compliant with applicable data privacy regulations. Some data sources have been provided as a one-time file, while others we refresh every time we do a new data build. Our data sources come from a variety of verticals, including HR Tech, Real Estate Tech, Identity/Anti-Fraud, Martech and others. People Data Labs actively works with suppliers on compliance-based topics since regulations are changing quickly.

## Public Data Sources

Our public data sources include open-sourced datasets, publicly available data, governmental public records and others as defined by various state and national laws. As public records, this data is compliant.

> 📘
>
> ### Job Posting Data Sourcing
>
> Our Job Posting Dataset is sourced exclusively from company career pages (as opposed to third party or other proprietary sources). We believe this is a unique differentiator for this dataset as it:
>
> * Provides a higher fidelity representation of the company's hiring activity (and avoids stale / zombie posts that are not as well-maintained on external job boards).
> * Provides coverage on smaller and younger companies that may not have presence on third party job boards
> * Provides a close-to-real-time signal of new and closed job posts since a company's career page is often the first place a company will update it's job openings

## Source Validation and Accuracy

Before we add a source to our data builds, it goes through multiple steps of validation. We check aggregate information across each source, ensure accurate cardinality between fields and hand-check large samples of every single source before we add it to the build. We take extensive measures to prevent false linkages that could adversely affect our product.

## Compliance

We evaluate data sources from a compliance standpoint before we integrate them into the dataset. The evaluation criteria includes a review of permissions and how the data has been obtained. We offer opt-outs and data request forms at the bottom of our website that any individual in the world can use. PDL generates various data attributes using metadata, aggregated data, inferences, or predictive models. None of our attributes are or describe sensitive personal data as defined by GDPR or the privacy laws of various US states. We also have a strict Acceptable Data Use Policy governing what our data can be used for, which you can find [here](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/acceptable-data-use-policy).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/identify-api-output-response

## Response Data Structure

The response from the Person Identify API will be in this format:

JSON

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "matches": [
    {
      "data": {
        ...
      },
      "match_score": 92,
      "matched_on": [
        "company",
        "name"
      ]
    },
    {
      "data": {
        ...
      },
      "match_score": 5,
      "matched_on": [
        "name"
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Response Fields

### `status`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The [API response code](/docs/errors). |

  

### `matches`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Array (Object)` | A list of up to 20 profiles matching the input criteria from the API request. Only returns profiles with a [`match_score`](#matchesmatch_score) greater than 5. |

Each object returned in the matches array will have the following attributes:

  

### `matches.match_score`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | How likely that this record is the record you're looking for based on your query. Will be between `1-99`. |

`match_score` measures how strongly a profile matches the input search criteria. The score is used to rank matching profiles and filter out profiles below a given score (default 5).

The more specific the input criteria is, the more useful the match\_score becomes. For example, if you wanted to find "John Smith", there would be too many possible matches. However, if you searched for "John Smith in New York City with the email address \_\_\_", it is much more likely that the profile with the highest `match_score` is the person you're looking for.

  

### `matches.data`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Object` | The full [person profile](/docs/fields) of the match. |

  

### `matches.matched_on`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Array (String)` | Which fields in the input query match the results in the returned profile.   * \*IMPORTANT:\*\* This field will only be included in the response if the [`include_if_matched` flag](/docs/input-parameters-person-identify-api#include_if_matched) is set to `true`. |

See the [`include_if_matched` input parameter](/docs/input-parameters-person-identify-api#include_if_matched) for more details.

  

## Errors

Any request that does not return a `200` success response will instead use the format described in [Errors](/docs/errors).

## What is the difference between the various Person APIs?

Check out [this page](/docs/person-endpoints#the-differences-between-our-person-related-apis) for a comparison of the various person-related APIs that we offer.

## Why don't all the profiles returned by the Person Identify API match for Enrichment?

The information returned by the Person Identify API contains the strongest set of profiles from our Person Dataset matching some input characteristics about a particular identity. These profiles each represent independent "chunks" of identity information.

Based on our strict [Entity Merging and De-Duplication](/docs/data-build#de-duplication) practices, we only merge profiles when we are very confident that they represent the same identity. Therefore, each profile contains highly self-consistent information about an identity.

The Person Identify API and the set of identities returned by the Person Identify API holds a more loosely connected but likely associated set of profiles in comparison to our more strict Person Enrichment API.

## Will I be charged a credit even if I don't receive a match?

Yes, the Person Identify API will charge for each requests regardless of whether or not you receive a match. This is contrary to the rest of our APIs that charge per successful match.

The reason we charge for reach request instead of each successful match is because receiving a non-match about information your pass to the Person Identify API is also a valuable data point. That information could be used as a signal to identify the information associated with an individual may not be related to an actual person.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/reference-person-search-api

The Person Search API is perfect for finding specific segments of people that you need to power your projects and products. It gives you direct access to our full [Person Dataset](/docs/datasets#api-dataset) and provides many degrees of freedom, which allow you to find any kind of person(s) with a single query.

# Endpoint

The endpoint for the Person Search API is `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/search`.

# Person Search API Access and Billing

We charge **per record retrieved**. Each person record in the `data` array of the response counts as a single credit against your total package.

# Requests

See [Authentication](/docs/authentication) and [Requests](/docs/requests) to learn how to input requests. We recommend using a JSON object to capture request parameters and will do so in the examples.

# Rate Limiting

The current default rate limit is 10 requests per minute.

# Input Parameters

> 📘
>
> ### For more details, see [Input Parameters - Person Search API](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api)
>
> You can also click on the individual parameter names in the table below to view more information on them.

| Parameter Name | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`query`](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#query) | An [Elasticsearch (v7.7) query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl.html). See our underlying [Elasticsearch mapping](#full-field-mapping) for reference. |  | `{"query": {"term": {"job_company_name": "people data labs"}}}` |
| [`sql`](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#sql) | An SQL query of the format: `SELECT * FROM person WHERE XXX`, where XXX is a standard SQL boolean query involving our [person fields](/docs/fields). We will ignore any use of column selections or the LIMIT keyword. |  | `SELECT * FROM person WHERE job_company_name='people data labs'` |
| [`size`](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#size) | The batch size or the maximum number of matched records to return for this query if they exist, which must be between `1` and `100`. | `1` | `100` |
| [`from`](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#from) | * \* Person The `from` field is not recommended for use and will not be supported long term. Use the `scroll_token` field instead\*\*An offset value for paginating between batches, which can be a number between`0` and `9999`. You can execute pagination for a maximum of 10,000 records per query. \*\*NOTE: YOU CANNOT USE `FROM` WITH `SCROLL_TOKEN` IN THE SAME REQUEST\*\*. | `0` | `0`, `100`, `200` ... |
| [`scroll_token`](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#scroll_token) | An offset key for paginating between batches. Unlike the legacy `from` parameter, you can use this parameter for any number of records. Each Person Search API response returns a `scroll_token`, which you can use to fetch the next `size` records. | `None` | `104$14.278746` |
| [`dataset`](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#dataset) | Specifies which [dataset](/docs/datasets) the API should search against. You can input multiple datasets by separating them with a comma. Valid names are `resume`, `email`, `phone`, `mobile_phone`, `street_address`, `consumer_social`, `developer` and `all`. You can also exclude datasets by using `-` as the first character. | `resume` | `all` |
| [`titlecase`](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#titlecase) | All text in the data of API responses returns as lowercase by default. Setting `titlecase` to `true` will titlecase any records returned. | `false` | `true` |
| [`pretty`](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#pretty) | Whether the output should have [human-readable](http://jsonprettyprint.net/) indentation. | `false` | `true` |
| [`api_key`](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#api_key) | Your secret API key.     **Note**: you can also provide this in the request header instead, as shown on the [Authentication](/docs/authentication) page. |  |  |

# Output Response

The API will return an HTTP response code of `200` for any valid request, regardless of whether it found records for your query or not. For that reason, pay close attention to the `total` value in your response object to understand query success. Each person record in the `data` array of the response counts as a single credit against your total package. The responses in the output are sorted by profile completeness.

## Overview

This section will describe the structure, request methods, and access for working with our APIS.

We've organized our APIs around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) commands and use HTTP response codes to indicate successful API calls and those that produce errors. We return all API responses, including errors, as [JSON](http://www.json.org) objects.

Our APIs reside at `api.peopledatalabs.com`. When making direct API requests in URL, you must do so over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). Calls made over standard HTTP will fail. API requests without proper Authentication (a valid API key) will also fail.

## API Structure

Structure

```
{BaseURL}/{version}/{entity}/{endpoint}?{parameters}
```

* **Base URL**: <https://api.peopledatalabs.com>
* **Version**: version number
  + All live endpoints operate on "v5"
* **Entity**: References the type of data to request
  + Person or Company or IP
* **Endpoint**: The type of product to request
  + Typically `enrich` or `search`
* **Parameters**: Each endpoint has a set of required parameters

Example

```
https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich?api_key=XXXX&profile=linkedin.com/in/seanthorne
```

## Methods

PDL support `GET` requests for all endpoints and `POST` for the following endpoints:

* [Person Enrichment API](/docs/person-enrichment-api)
* [Person Search API](/docs/person-search-api)
* [Company Search API](/docs/company-search-api)
* [Autocomplete API](/docs/autocomplete-api)
* [Cleaner APIs](/docs/cleaner-apis)
* [Job Title Enrichment API](/docs/job-title-enrichment-api)

## Access

You can access our APIs via:

* Custom scripts in the language of your choice
* One of our [SDKs](/docs/overview)
* Use our [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/pdl-official/workspace/people-data-labs-workspace/collection/32867294-ef278c05-d32d-47a1-b147-b819bc96238a?action=share&creator=32867294)

To read more about our persistent Person ID logic, please consult our [Persistent IDs](/docs/persistent-ids) page.

## Person Changelog

We also provide an additional changelog as a flat file in [this public AWS bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/pdl-prod-id-changelog?region=us-west-2&prefix=33.1/&showversions=false). Each part of the changelog is capped to a file size of approximately 100MB. Changelogs are separated by update cadence with the following paths:

* Monthly: `s3://pdl-prod-id-changelog/version_number/monthly/`
* Quarterly: `s3://pdl-prod-id-changelog/version_number/quarterly/`

Here is a description of each possible record status:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `added` | Newly added records |
| `deleted` | Records that have been deleted |
| `merged` | Records merged into other records, including metadata of the merged records |
| `opted_out` | Records that have opted out through our website |
| `updated` | Records where a value in any field has changed and/or a profile has been merged into the record |

### Additional Metadata

Some of the statuses listed in the table above will also contain the following metadata:

| Metadata Field | Corresponding Version Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contains` | `updated` | The persistent IDs of any records that existed in a previous version and have been merged before or during the current version. |
| `fields_updated` | `updated` | The specific fields of the record that have changed. Changes for child fields will be limited to their parents. For example, if a record’s `experience.end_date` changes, that will be shown as `“fields_updated”: [“experience”]`. |
| `to` | `merged` | The persistent ID that this record has been assigned in the current version. |

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/quickstart-wrapup

We have covered a lot with this Quickstart. Here’s a recap:

* You created a PDL account and got a free API key, which you can use to access a variety of API endpoints
* You used a simple URL to look up person profiles in our PDL dataset right in your browser by LinkedIn URL (in the data world, we’d say that you “enriched” a profile using a LinkedIn URL)
* You learned how to use the Person Enrichment API to look up person profile records
* You also learned how to use the Company Enrichment API to look up company profile records
* You saw multiple examples of person and company profiles that you retrieved from our datasets.

Not bad for a few minutes of copying and pasting 😁

To continue your learning in the API Dashboard, check out the [API Dashboard Quickstart](https://blog.peopledatalabs.com/post/self-signup-api-quickstart) for a high level overview of the available features and functionality.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/reference-company-search-api

The Company Search API is perfect for finding specific segments of companies that you need to power your projects and products. It gives you direct access to our full [Company Dataset](/docs/company-fields). There are many degrees of freedom, which allow you to find any kind of company with a single query.

# Endpoint

The endpoint for the Company Search API is `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/search`.

# Company Search API Access and Billing

We charge **per record retrieved**. Each company record in the `data` array in the response counts as one credit against your total package.

# Requests

See [Authentication](/docs/authentication) and [Requests](/docs/requests) to learn how to input requests. We recommend using a JSON object to capture request parameters and will do so in the examples.

# Rate Limiting

The current default rate limit is 10 requests per minute.

# Input Parameters

> 📘
>
> ### For More Details, See [Input Parameters - Company Search API](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api)
>
> You can also click on the individual parameter names in the table below to view more information on them.

| Parameter Name | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`query`](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#query) | An [Elasticsearch (v7.7) query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/query-dsl.html). See our underlying [Elasticsearch mapping](#full-field-mapping) for reference. |  | `{"query": {"term": {"name": "people data labs"}}}` |
| [`sql`](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#sql) | An SQL query of the format: `SELECT * FROM company WHERE XXX`, where XXX is a standard SQL boolean query involving our [company fields](/docs/company-fields). We will ignore any use of column selections or the LIMIT keyword. |  | `SELECT * FROM company WHERE name='people data labs'` |
| [`size`](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#size) | The batch size or the maximum number of matched records to return for this query if they exist. Must be between `1` and `100`. | `1` | `100` |
| [`from`](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#from) | **[LEGACY] The `from` field is not recommended for use and will not be supported long term. Use the `scroll_token` field instead** An offset value for paginating between batches, which can be a number between `0` and `9999`. We will execute pagination for a maximum of 10,000 records per query. **NOTE: YOU CANNOT USE `FROM` WITH `SCROLL_TOKEN` IN THE SAME REQUEST**. | `0` | `0`, `100`, `200` ... |
| [`scroll_token`](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#scroll_token) | An offset key for paginating between batches. Unlike the legacy `from`, you can use this parameter for any number of records. Each Company Search API response returns a `scroll_token`, which you can use to fetch the next `size` records. | `None` | `104$14.278746` |
| [`titlecase`](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#titlecase) | All text in API responses returns as lowercase by default. Setting `titlecase` to `true` will titlecase the person data in `200` responses. | `false` | `true` |
| [`pretty`](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#pretty) | Whether the output should have [human-readable](http://jsonprettyprint.net/) indentation. | `false` | `true` |
| [`api_key`](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#api_key) | Your secret API key (**Note**: you can also provide this in the request header instead, as shown on the [Authentication](/docs/authentication) page). |  |  |

# Output Response

We will return an HTTP response code of `200` for any valid request, regardless of whether records were found for your query or not. For that reason, pay close attention to the `total` value in your response object to understand query success. Each company record in the `data` array of the response counts as a single credit against your total package. The responses in the output are sorted by profile completeness.

## Response Fields

> 📘
>
> ### For More Details, See [Output Response - Company Search API](/docs/output-response-company-search-api)
>
> You can also click the field names in the table below to view more information as well.

| Field | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`status`](/docs/output-response-company-search-api#status) | The response code. See a description of our [error codes](errors). | `Integer` |
| [`data`](/docs/output-response-company-search-api#data) | The company response objects that match the input query (see the [example company record](/docs/example-company-record). | `Array (Object)` |
| [`total`](/docs/output-response-company-search-api#total) | The number of records matching a given `query` or `sql` input. | `Integer` |
| [`scroll_token`](/docs/output-response-company-search-api#scroll_token) | The scroll value, which you can use for further pagination. | `String` |

## Response Data Structure

The response from the Company Search API will be in this format:

JSON

```
{
    "status": 200,
    "data": [
        {
          "id": "tnHcNHbCv8MKeLh92946LAkX6PKg",
          "name": "people data labs",
          ...
        },
        ...
    ],
    "total": 6,
    "scroll_token": "13.312621$543927"
}
```

See [Example Company Record](/docs/example-company-record) for a full example of the fields included in the `data` object.

## Errors

If the request encounters an error, it will instead return an Error Response in the format described in [Errors](/docs/errors).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/reference-company-enrichment-api

The Company Enrichment API provides a **one-to-one** company match. The company data provided by this endpoint includes all the fields in our [Company Schema](/docs/company-fields).

# Endpoint

The endpoint for the Company Enrichment API is `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/enrich`.

# Company Enrichment API Access and Billing

When the API finds a matching company, it returns this company along with an HTTP response code of `200`. When it doesn't find a matching company, it returns an HTTP response code of `404`. We charge **per match**.

# Requests

See [Authentication](/docs/authentication) and [Requests](/docs/requests) for how to input requests. We recommend using a JSON object to capture request parameters and will do so in the examples.

# Rate Limiting

The standard rate limit is 10 per minute for free customers and 1,000 per minute for paying customers.

# Input Parameters

When querying the API in URL, you can add data points to a queried company as key/value pairs at the end of a `v5` request string.

You can use the following parameters to specify information about the requested company. Adding more data points to a request increases the probability of a `200` response and increases the [likelihood score](/docs/output-response-company-enrichment-api#likelihood-score). Adding unique parameters such as `website`, `ticker` or `profile` are more likely to yield a match than a `name`.

## Additional Input Parameters

You are not required to use the following additional input parameters. They generally transform or control various aspects of the enrichment process (returning matches or formatting results.)

| Parameter Name | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`titlecase`](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api#titlecase) | All text in API responses returns as lowercase by default. Setting titlecase to `true` will titlecase the person data in `200` responses. | `false` | `true` |
| [`pretty`](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api#pretty) | Whether the output should have [human-readable](http://jsonprettyprint.net/) indentation. | `false` | `true` |
| [`include_if_matched`](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api#include_if_matched) | If `true`, the response includes the top-level field `matched` (along with `data`, `status` and so forth), which includes a value for each queried field parameter that was matched during our internal query. | `false` | `true` |
| [`min_likelihood`](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api#min_likelihood) | The minimum `likelihood` score that a response must have to return a `200`. | `2` | `6` |
| [`required`](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api#min_likelihood) | The fields a response must have to return a `200`. |  | `ticker` |
| [`data_include`](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api#data_include) | A comma-separated string of fields that you want the response to include.  Begin the string with a `-` if you want to *exclude* the specified fields. If you want to exclude all data from being returned, use `data_include=""`. |  | `"full_name,emails.address"` |

# Output Response

When you execute an API request, we preprocess the queried data points and build them into a query, which we then execute against our [Company Dataset](/docs/company-stats). Most profiles and websites map to a unique company. We fuzzy-match company names based on name appearance relative to different unique company profiles. The company name that appears most frequently in our data is the one that is most likely to be the company returned in a `200` HTTP response code. If we do not find a match or cannot resolve the query to a unique company based on a `name`, we will return a `404` HTTP response code.

## Response Fields

> 📘
>
> ### For More Details, See [Output Response - Company Enrichment API](/docs/output-response-company-enrichment-api)
>
> You can also click the field names in the table below to view more information on them.

| Field | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`status`](/docs/output-response-company-enrichment-api#status) | The response code (see a description of our [error codes](errors)). | `Integer` |
| [`likelihood`](/docs/output-response-company-enrichment-api#likelihood) | The degree of confidence. The field is an integer between `1` and `10` that represents how confident we are that the company that we returned is the same as the company that you requested. You can control the minimum likelihood score a response must have in order to return a `200` by using the `min_likelihood` parameter in the API request. | `Integer` |
| [`*`](/docs/output-response-company-enrichment-api#section-) | The matched profile record containing fields from our [Company Schema](/docs/company-fields). Any fields in the profile record that do not contain any data will have a `null` value. |  |

## Response Data Structure

Here is an example response from the Company Enrichment API:

JSON

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "name": "people data labs",
  "id": "tnHcNHbCv8MKeLh92946LAkX6PKg",
  ...,
  "likelihood": 6
}
```

See [Example Company Record](/docs/example-company-record) for a full example of the fields included in the response object.

## Errors

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/data-delivery-using-direct-download

## What are Direct Downloads

Historically, People Data Labs only offered a **Push** delivery model for our Data License customers - where we send your dataset directly to a storage location that you own and have configured (e.g. S3, Azure, GCP, Snowflake, etc).

**Push**: Delivery initiated by PDL

As of November 2025, we now also offer a **Pull** option: **Direct Downloads**.

**Pull**: You download data via SFTP / SSH

  

With Direct Downloads, instead of you creating the destination bucket, we create and host it for you. Once your data is delivered, you can securely download it on your schedule via SFTP or SSH. You’ll also get an email notification as soon as each delivery is ready.

  

## Why Switch to Direct Downloads

If you are currently a Data License customer receiving data to a bucket that you control (e.g. the Push Model), switching to Direct Downloads offers several key benefits, including:

**No setup required on your end.**
We handle the bucket creation and maintenance, so you don’t need to configure credentials.

**Pull on your own schedule.**
Download deliveries whenever it's most convenient for your team—no waiting on a push, no dependency on storage syncing.

**Simple, secure access.**
Use standard tools like SFTP, SSH, or AWS to access your data securely with credentials you manage through the PDL dashboard.

**No Additional Cost**  
There is no additional charge for using the Direct Downloads delivery method (or for switching from a Pull delivery method).

## How to Get Started

To get started with Direct Downloads, just follow these quick steps:

1. **Contact your CSM**  
   Let your Customer Success Manager know you'd like to switch to Direct Downloads. Our team will handle the backend setup and spin up your secure bucket. *Note: a minor contract amendment for the adjusted delivery location may be required.*
2. **Set your Credentials**  
   Once, we've enabled your new delivery method, go to the **Settings** area of your PDL Dashboard to retrieve your username and setup your password or SSH key.

Accessing and configuring credentials in the PDL Dashboard

3. **Connect & Download**  
   You'll get a notification each time a new dataset is delivered. Using, your preferred SFTP client, connect with any collection of the following:
   1. **Host**: `pdl.sftp.peopledatalabs.com`
   2. **SFTP URL**: `[username]@pdl.sftp.peopledatalabs.com:`
   3. **Port**: 22
   4. **Username + Password** *or* **SSH Key**  
      From there, you can download your files at your convenience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **🔐 Is this method secure?**

Yes. All connections use encrypted SFTP (or SSH with secure credentials). You control access on your end just like with traditional pull-based systems.

### **🧰 Can I connect using command line tools (like `sftp`)?**

Yes! You can connect directly to the PDL-hosted bucket using standard SFTP commands in your terminal. Once your credentials are set, here are a few bash examples:

Shell

```
# Start an SFTP session
sftp [username]@pdl.sftp.peopledatalabs.com

# After logging in:
ls                    # List available files
get dataset.csv       # Download a specific file
mget *.csv            # Download all CSV files
mget *                # Download all files
scp -r                # Download everything in selected directory
bye                   # Exit the session
```

### **📅 When are deliveries made?**

Delivery timing doesn’t change: your data will still be delivered according to your current monthly or quarterly schedule. You’ll get an email notification when it's ready to download.

### **📁 Will older deliveries be available in the bucket?**

By default, any data placed in the bucket will expire after 110 days in order to conserve resources. This allows for some wiggle room if you need any past deliveries.

### **💸 Does this cost extra?**

Nope! It’s just a different delivery method - no additional cost required.

# Examples

We've provided code samples in Python, cURL, Ruby, Go and JavaScript. If you aren't comfortable working in any of these languages, feel free to use this [handy tool](https://curl.trillworks.com/) to convert code from cURL to the language of your choice.

> ❗️
>
> ### Heads Up! Credit Usage
>
> Person Search API calls cost the number of **total search results** returned.
>
> If you are making a search that could have a large number of results, make sure to use the [`size` parameter](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#size) to set the maximum number of results and cap your credit usage.

> 💡
>
> ### We want your feedback!
>
> Do you see a bug? Is there an example you'd like to see that's not listed here?
>
> Head over to the public roadmap and submit a [bug ticket](https://peopledatalabs.canny.io/bugs) or a [feature request](https://peopledatalabs.canny.io/feature-requests) and receive automatic notifications as your bug is resolved or your request is implemented.

## Using POST Requests

*"I want to use POST requests instead of GET requests so that I can make queries with a lot of parameters."*

> 📘
>
> ### Difference Between GET and POST Requests
>
> See this article for a comparison of the [differences between GET and POST requests](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp). The biggest difference is that POST requests don't have any limits on the amount of data that you can pass in the request.

## Searching Specific Datasets

*"I want to run a simple query against PDL's[Phone Dataset](/docs/datasets#phone-slice)."*

> 📘
>
> ### Maintaining Backwards Compatibility
>
> We introduced the `dataset` parameter with the [July 2021 release](/changelog/july-2021-release-notes#changing-the-default-de-duplication-in-the-search-api), in which we also changed the default dataset from `all` to `resume`. For users that want to maintain the same performance in their queries as prior to this change, set the `dataset` parameter to `all` in the example below.

## Bulk Retrieval

*"I want to pull all current employees at Amazon and save their profiles to a CSV file."*

> 🚧
>
> ### High Credit Usage Code Below
>
> The code example below illustrates retrieving all the employee profiles in a large company and is meant primarily for demonstrating the use of the `scroll_token` parameter when requesting large amounts of records. As a result, this code is mostly illustrative in purpose. It can further expend a lot of credits and doesn't have any error handling. The `MAX_NUM_RECORDS_LIMIT` parameter in the example sets the maximum number of profiles that we will retrieve (and the maximum number of credits that you will expend), so please set it accordingly when testing this example.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/job-title-enrichment-api

## Overview

The Job Title Enrichment API lets you enrich data on a job title by performing a one-to-one match of this job title with those included in our [Job Title](/docs/job-title-schema) Dataset. Once matched, you can search for profiles with less context. For example, instead of explicitly searching for "supply managers, supply chain managers, supply specialists and supply coordinators," you can search for "supply managers and similar job titles."

**Note**: Our current Job Title Dataset only contains job titles seen at least 100 times across our global resume data.

  

## Expected Usage

This API functions primarily as a support for our [Person Search API](/docs/person-search-api). Once you enhance a job title, you can use the returned information in your Person Search query to find better matches in our Person Dataset.

We expect the flow for using the Job Title Enrichment and Person Search APIs to broadly follow one of the two patterns shown in the diagrams below:

Flow 1: Using the Job Title Enrichment API to search for people with similar job titles.



Flow 2: Using the Job Title Enrichment API to search for people with skills relevant to the job title.

  
  

## What's Next

# Endpoint

The endpoint for the Autocomplete API is: `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/autocomplete`.

# Autocomplete API Access and Billing

By default, all active API keys have free access to the Autocomplete API.

When monitoring usage, each call to the Autocomplete API counts against the daily rate limit, regardless of the records available.

# Rate Limiting

Our default limit for self-serve customers is 60 requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day. For enterprise customers, we offer rate limits of up to 1,200 requests per minute. If you are interested in higher rate limits, please [reach out to us](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/talk-to-sales).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api

## Required Parameters

The request must have enough data points to find a clear match. A valid request must include **at least one** of: OR [`pdl_id`](#pdl_id) OR [`name`](#name) OR [`ticker`](#ticker) OR [`website`](#website) OR [`profile`](#profile).

### `api_key`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | Your secret API key. |  |  |

Your API Key **must** be included in either the request header or the api\_key parameter. For more information about request authentication, see the [Authentication](/docs/authentication) page.

---

## Optional Parameters

### `pdl_id`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The PDL ID or `linkedin_slug` for a record in our Company Dataset.    **Note**: If you enrich using `pdl_id` and anything else, only the `pdl_id` field is used and the other inputs for matching are ignored. | `aKCIYBNF9ey6o5CjHCCO4goHYKlf`or `google` |

### `name`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The company's name. | `Google, Inc.` |

### `profile`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The company's social profile. | `linkedin.com/company/google` |

### `ticker`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The company's stock ticker, if publicly traded. | `GOOGL` |

### `website`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The company's website. | `google.com` |

### `location`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The location of the company's headquarters. This can be anything from a street address to a country name. | `1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043` |

You can input multiple location values.

### `street_address`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The company HQ's street address. | `1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy` |

### `locality`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The company HQ's locality. | `Mountain View` |

### `region`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The company HQ's region. | `California` |

### `country`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The company HQ's country. | `United States` |

### `postal_code`

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The company HQ's postal code. | `83701` |

### `data_include`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | A comma-separated string of [company fields](/docs/company-schema) that you want the response to include. |  | `"name,location.metro"` |

If this input parameter is not included, the full [company profile](/docs/company-schema) will be returned.

Include multiple fields by separating each with a comma. Include specific subfields by using dot notation (ex: `location.metro`).

Exclude field(s) by using `-` as the first character. Entering `-` will exclude all of the comma-separated fields following the character and needs to be entered only once. For example, `"-founded,location"` will remove the `founded` and `location` fields from the enriched profile response.

To exclude all data from being returned, use `data_include=""`.

### `pretty`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | Whether the output should have [human-readable](http://jsonprettyprint.net/) indentation. | `false` | `true` |

### `titlecase`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | All text in API responses returns as lowercase by default. Setting `titlecase` to `true` will titlecase response data instead. | `false` | `true` |

### `include_if_matched`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | If `true`, the response will include the top-level field `matched` that contains a list of every input that matched this profile. | `false` | `true` |

As an example, if we wanted to enrich PDL using the following query:

JSON

```
{
   "name": "people data labs",
   "profile": "linkedin.com/company/peopledatalabs",
   "country": "abu dhabi",
   "include_if_matched": true
}
```

The response would contain:

JSON

```
{
   "matched": [
        "name",
        "profile"
    ]
}
```

### `min_likelihood`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The minimum likelihood score that a profile must have in order for it to count as a match. Will be between `1-10`. | `2` | `6` |

This parameter allows you to balance precision and recall. In other words, using a high `min_likelihood` value will only return very strong matches but at the risk of not returning any match at all if none can be found above the `min_likelihood` threshold. Alternatively, using a low `min_likelihood` value is more likely to give you a match but at the cost of returning a potentially weaker match.

By default, match recall is kept very high, so a response that returns a likelihood score of `2` will have roughly a 10-30% chance of being the company requested. Adding more data points to your requests will increase the probability of a successful match (high likelihood score and is actually the requested company).

Here are some general rules of thumb for setting this parameter:

* For use cases which rely on a high degree of data accuracy, use a value ≥ `6`.
* Requests made with only a few less-specific data points, such as a name alone, will return lower scores.
* Requests made with just a name return a score between `2` and `5`, based on the quality of the match.

### `required`

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | The fields a response must have in order to count as a match. |  | `location AND (website OR linkedin_url)` |

This parameter ensures that we only charge for responses that include the data fields that you're interested in. You can use any top-level [company fields](/docs/company-fields) except those that you use as search parameters and input fields. If you include a field in both the request and the `required` parameter, the `required` parameter will not work.

Format the value as a boolean statement.

**Examples**

*The response must contain a Linkedin URL*:

cURL

```
required=linkedin_url
```

*The response must contain location and a website*:

cURL

```
required=location AND website
```

*The response must contain a location or website*:

cURL

```
required=location OR website
```

*The response must contain a location and either a website or linkedin\_url*:

cURL

```
required=location AND (website OR linkedin_url)
```

### `size`

> 🚧
>
> ### Warning: Enterprise-Only Parameter
>
> The following parameter is only available for Enterprise customers. To enable the `size` parameter, speak with your Data Consultant.

| Type | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The maximum number of results to return (between 1-100). | `1` | `10` |

If this parameter is included in the request with a value greater than 1, that number of matching results will be returned sorted from highest [likelihood score](/docs/output-response-company-enrichment-api#likelihood) to lowest (within the [`min_likelihood`](#min_likelihood) score threshold).

Using this parameter will change the response type to an **array of objects** as shown in the example below.

**NOTE:** Each profile that is returned in the `data` array will cost 1 Company Enrichment credit, so use caution when setting this parameter.

**Example**

JSON

```
{
  "name": "MRI",
  "size": 2
}
```

## Sandbox Person Enrichment API

To use the Sandbox Person Enrichment API in URL, set `https://sandbox.api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich` as the URL and then use the Person Enrichment API as usual.

To use the Sandbox Person Enrichment API with our SDKs, see [SDK usage](/docs/sandbox-apis-reference#sdk-usage).

After implementing one of the two mechanisms above, you can make use of any of the [examples for the Person Enrichment API](/docs/examples-person-enrichment-api). **However, since the Sandbox APIs only use the[Sandbox Dataset](/docs/sandbox-apis-reference#sandbox-dataset), you can only enrich profiles from that dataset**. For example, here is how to perform enrichment on an email address from the [Sandbox Dataset](/docs/sandbox-apis-reference#sandbox-dataset) following the [Email example](/docs/examples-person-enrichment-api#email):

### Basic Usage

Python3 SDKJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
import json

# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
    # Use Sandbox API
    sandbox=True,
)

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
    "email": ["irussell@example.org"],
    "min_likelihood": 6
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
json_response = CLIENT.person.enrichment(**PARAMS).json()

# Check for successful response
if json_response["status"] == 200:
  record = json_response['data']

  # Print selected fields
  print(
    record['work_email'],
    record['full_name'],
    record['job_title'],
    record['job_company_name']
  )

  print(f"Successfully enriched profile with PDL data.")

  # Save enrichment data to JSON file
  with open("my_pdl_enrichment.jsonl", "w") as out:
    out.write(json.dumps(record) + "\n")
else:
  print("Enrichment unsuccessful. See error and try again.")
  print("error:", json_response)
```

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLJSClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: "YOUR API KEY" });

// Create a parameters JSON object

## Sandbox Person Search API

To use the Sandbox Person Search API in URL, set `https://sandbox.api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/search` as the URL and then use the Person Search API as usual.

To use the Sandbox Person Search API with our SDKs, see [SDK usage](/docs/sandbox-apis-reference#sdk-usage).

After implementing one of the two mechanisms above, you can make use of any of the [examples for the Person Search API](/docs/examples-person-search-api). **However, since the Sandbox APIs only use the[Sandbox Dataset](/docs/sandbox-apis-reference#sandbox-dataset), you can only search for profiles from that dataset**.

## Sandbox Person Identify API

To use the Sandbox Person Identify API in URL, set `https://sandbox.api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/identify` as the URL and then use the Person Identify API as usual.

To use the Sandbox Person Identify API with our SDKs, see [SDK usage](/docs/sandbox-apis-reference#sdk-usage).

After implementing one of the two mechanisms above, you can make use of any of the [examples for the Person Identify API](/docs/identify-api-examples). **However, since the Sandbox APIs only use the[Sandbox Dataset](/docs/sandbox-apis-reference#sandbox-dataset), you can only match profiles from that dataset**. For example, here is how to perform a query following the [Basic Usage example](/docs/identify-api-examples#basic-usage):

### Basic Usage

Python3 SDKJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
import json

# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
    # Use Sandbox API
    sandbox=True,
)

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
 "company": "walmart",
 "pretty": True
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Identify API
response_data = CLIENT.person.identify(**PARAMS).json()

# Create a list of matches
identities = response_data['matches']

# Print the matches in JSON format
print(identities)
print(f"Found {len(identities)} identities!")
```

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLJSClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: "YOUR API KEY" });

// Create a parameters JSON object
const params = {
  company: "walmart",
  pretty: true,
  // Use Sandbox API
  sandbox: true
}

// Pass the parameters object to the Person Identify API
PDLJSClient.person.identify(params).then((data) => {
  // Create a list of matches
  var identities = data["matches"]
  
  // Print the matches in JSON format
  console.log(identities);
  console.log(`Found ${identities.length} identities!`)
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
```

```
# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-ruby
require 'peopledatalabs'

# Set your API key
Peopledatalabs.api_key = 'YOUR API KEY'

# Use Sandbox API
Peopledatalabs.sandbox = true

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
 "company": "walmart",
 "pretty": true
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Identify API
response = Peopledatalabs::Identify.person(params: PARAMS)

# Create a list of matches

## Can I use the Company Search API to enrich data?

The Company Search API ignores the matching logic in our Company Enrichment API. We don't do any preprocessing (cleaning) of the inputs to the Company Search API, so you're almost guaranteed to have a lower match rate.

What's more, Company Search API queries and Company Enrichment API queries are structured differently. When you make a Company Enrichment API request, we have a custom-built query that takes the different input parameters and weights them differently, only returning a match in certain cases while using stack ranking in cases where there are multiple matches.

## Should I use SQL or Elasticsearch for the Company Search API?

Use **Elasticsearch** when:

1. You have complicated boolean queries.
2. You want to maximize the control that you have over text-based matching (titles, summaries and so forth.)
3. You are comfortable writing Elasticsearch queries.

Use **SQL** when:

1. You are running simple searches with only a few parameters.
2. You're exclusively using ENUM parameters from our data (location, industry, etc.)
3. You are comfortable writing SQL queries.

## Can I use wildcards in my search query?

Yes, wildcard terms are supported. However, we have a hard limit of 20 wildcards per query. See the relevant sections for more information about the limitations in [Elasticsearch](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#elasticsearch-query-limitations) and [SQL](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#sql-query-limitations) search queries.

## Why is there a 1MB limit on the API requests and the response body?

The error message that you are receiving has occurred because the query is too large and cURL can't handle the response. Calling the API with Python should alleviate this issue as Python compresses the extra space within an Elasticsearch query. Additional ways to decrease the query size are to reduce the profile count parameter from `100` to `60` for each call and to remove the `pretty` tag. You can get around this limitation by [Using POST Requests](/docs/examples-person-search-api#using-post-requests).

## Can I exclude PDL IDs in a Company Search call to avoid spending duplicate credits?

You can technically exclude up to 1,000 PDL IDs in a single search query, however you will eventually run into limitations due to our infrastructure. While the PDL ID is mostly persistent, it's possible that the IDs can get merged, deleted, or opted out from our dataset across releases. Additionally, we will truncate extremely long queries in our internal logs, making it more difficult to assist you should you need technical support. At some point in the future, we will place limitations on query length and/or performance time to avoid these costly queries.

## Will I be charged for retrieving the same profile multiple times?

Yes. PDL will charge for the retrieval of the same profile.

Example 1  
You search for companies in California then conduct another search for companies in San Francisco. You will be charged for the overlap in the second request.

Example 2  
You search for companies in California and search again for companies in California. You will be charged the same amount for each request.

Example 1 is a bit more difficult to handle for programmatically and likely needs a UI/UX approach to limit overlapping queries.

To handle for situations demonstrated in Example 2, PDL recommends duplicate call detection. You can use methods like unique key constraints. For example, you can hash the request, storing the hash, and checking for a duplicate call before sending it to the API to avoid the second situation above.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/output-response-person-search-api

## Response Data Structure

The response from the Person Search API will be in this format:

JSON

```
{
    "status": 200,
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "qEnOZ5Oh0poWnQ1luFBfVw_0000",
            "full_name": "sean thorne",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ],
    "scroll_token": "1117$12.176522",
    "total": 99
}
```

See [Example Person Record](/docs/example-record) for a full example of the fields included in the `data` object.

## Response Fields

### `data.*`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Array (Object)` | The person response objects that match the input query in the format described in our [Person Schema](/docs/fields). |

The `data` list is made up of objects that contain the entire [PDL profile](/docs/fields) for each person that matches the Search API request. Any profile field that we do not have data for will have a `null` value.

  

### `status`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The [API response code](/docs/errors). |

  

### `total`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The total number of records that matched the input query. |

  

### `scroll_token`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `String` | The scroll token to use to fetch the next batch of results for the query. |

For more information on using `scroll_token`, see [here](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#scroll_token).

## Errors

Any request that does not return a `200` success response will instead use the format described in [Errors](/docs/errors).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/output-response-cleaner-apis

## Company Cleaner API Response

Here is an example response from the Company Cleaner API:

JSON

```
{
    "status": 200,
    "name": "people data labs",
    "size": "51-200",
    "id": "tnHcNHbCv8MKeLh92946LAkX6PKg",
    "founded": 2015,
    "industry": "computer software",
    "location": {
        "name": "san francisco, california, united states",
        "locality": "san francisco",
        "region": "california",
        "metro": "san francisco, california",
        "country": "united states",
        "continent": "north america",
        "street_address": "455 market street",
        "address_line_2": "suite 1670",
        "postal_code": "94105",
        "geo": "37.77,-122.41"
    },
    "linkedin_url": "linkedin.com/company/peopledatalabs",
    "linkedin_id": "18170482",
    "facebook_url": "facebook.com/peopledatalabs",
    "twitter_url": "twitter.com/peopledatalabs",
    "website": "peopledatalabs.com",
    "ticker": null,
    "type": "private",
    "raw": [
        "people data labs"
    ],
    "score": 4.0,
    "fuzzy_match": false
}
```

If the Company Cleaner API finds a matching company, a `200` response returns along with the company record in JSON format. The schema of the response matches the Company Schema in the Person record. If the API does not find a matching company, a  `404` returns.

For querying the Company Schema, you can use the the following field mapping:

| company field | person fields |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `job_company_id`, `experience.company.id` |

## Location Cleaner API Response

Here is an example response from the Location Cleaner API:

JSON

```
{
  "name": "portland, oregon, united states",
  "locality": "portland",
  "region": "oregon",
  "subregion": "multnomah county",
  "country": "united states",
  "continent": "north america",
  "type": "locality",
  "geo": "45.52,-122.67",
}
```

If the Location Cleaner API parses the location, a `200` response returns along with the parsed location in JSON format. The schema of the response matches the Location Schema in the Person record. If the API cannot parse the location, a  `404` returns.

For querying the Location Schema, you can use the the following field mapping:

| location field | person fields |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | `job_company_location_name`, `location_name`, `location_names`, `street_addresses.name`, `experience.location_names`, `experience.company.location.name`, `education.school.location.name` |

## School Cleaner API Response

Here is an example response from the School Cleaner API:

JSON

```
{
  "name": "university of california, los angeles",
  "type": "post-secondary institution",
  "id": "72978d72-275a-49c8-b9b9-f227ccfb1361",
  "location": {
    "name": "los angeles, california, united states",
    "locality": "los angeles",
    "region": "california",
    "country": "united states",
    "continent": "north america"
  },
  "linkedin_url": "linkedin.com/school/ucla",
  "facebook_url": null,
  "twitter_url": null,
  "linkedin_id": "17950",
  "website": "ucla.edu",
  "domain": "ucla.edu"
}
```

If the School Cleaner API finds a matching school, a `200` response returns along with the cleaned school in JSON format. The schema of the response matches the School Schema in the Person record. If the API doesn't find a matching school, a  `404` returns.

For querying the School Schema, you can use the the following field mapping:

| school field | person field |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `education.school.id` |

## What is the metadata field in the API response?

The [metadata field](/docs/output-response-autocomplete-api#datameta) is a set of contextual information associated with each autocomplete suggestion, which you can use to further identify the entity suggested. For example, when requesting company autocomplete suggestions, metadata such as `website`, `industry` and `location` can help identify exactly what company a suggestion is referring to.

**Note**: not all responses will have metadata. It depends on the type of [Input Parameters - Autocomplete API](/docs/input-parameters-autocomplete-api#fields) that you specified in the input request. Some fields, such as `industry` and `skills`, do not contain metadata because there is no other contextual information that can further identify each suggestion beyond the name. For example, there's not much context that you can provide on the skill `JavaScript` beyond its name.

You can see a detailed list of the metadata fields associated with each type of input field [here](/docs/output-response-autocomplete-api#metadata-fields-for-company).

## Overview

The Person Identify API allows you to use broad search inputs to retrieve multiple records from our person dataset. In particular, this endpoint enables functionality such as searching through a single identifying attribute, such as name, email, phone number, company, school or location, in addition to using any combination of these attributes [and more](/docs/reference-person-identify-api#input-parameters). The API then scores and sorts all matching records that it returns based on the [strength of their association with the input parameters](/docs/output-response-person-identify-api#matchesmatch_score).

> 📘
>
> ### How Does the Person Identify API Compare with Other Person-Related Endpoints?
>
> See our [Introduction](/docs/introduction#the-differences-between-our-person-related-apis) for a detailed breakdown regarding the differences between the Person Identify API and our other person-related products.

## Use Cases

A key use case for this endpoint is building comprehensive profiles for specific individuals, such as in the areas of:

* Investigations and forensics
* Fraud risk modeling
* Identity modeling for customer onboarding and other [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) applications

## How it Works

At a high level, the Person Identify API works as follows:

1. You specify some characteristics about the identity that you are interested in and pass these as [input parameters](/docs/identify-api-input-parameters) to the API.
2. The API [cleans](/docs/cleaner-apis) the input parameter values and searches our Person Dataset for matching profiles using fuzzy-matching logic.
3. The API returns up to 20 of the the best matching profiles in its response while ranking them by their [match score](/docs/identify-api-output-response#matchesmatch_score).

As mentioned in the [Overview](/docs/person-search-api#overview), the Person Search API is a means of filtering and segmenting individual profiles included in our [Person Dataset](/docs/fields). In order to use the Person Search API, **you will need to use either an[Elasticsearch query](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#query) or an [SQL query](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#sql)**.

Here's a quick example to search for profiles whose `location_country` is `mexico`, whose `job_title_role` is `health`, and whose record includes at least one `phone_numbers`:

> ### Heads Up! Credit Usage
>
> Person Search API calls cost the number of **total search results** returned.
>
> If you are making a search that could have a large number of results, make sure to use the [`size` parameter](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#size) to set the maximum number of results and cap your credit usage.

## What is the difference between the various Person APIs?

See [this section](/docs/person-endpoints#the-differences-between-our-person-related-apis) for a detailed breakdown of the differences between our Person APIs.

## Can I get a likelihood score in the Person Search API?

The likelihood score that we return in our Enrichment APIs represents the likelihood of the matching logic given the input parameters, so it wouldn't be relevant in the Person Search API.

## Can I use the Person Search API to enrich data?

The Person Search API ignores the [nuances in our Person Enrichment API matching logic](https://www.notion.so/Enrichment-API-Tips-and-Tricks-52a19eaf2b7e412790232f205d63bcab). We don't do any preprocessing (cleaning) of the inputs to the Person Search API, so you're almost guaranteed to have a lower match rate.

What's more, Person Search API queries and Person Enrichment API queries are structured differently. When you make a Person Enrichment API request, we have a custom-built query that takes the different input parameters and weights them differently, only returning a match in certain cases while using stack ranking in cases where there are multiple matches (for example, John Smith in San Francisco.)

## Should I use SQL or Elasticsearch for the Person Search API?

Use **Elasticsearch** when:

1. You have complicated boolean queries.
2. You want to maximize the control that you have over text-based matching (titles, summaries and so forth.)
3. You are comfortable writing Elasticsearch queries.

Use **SQL** when:

1. You are running simple searches with only a few parameters.
2. You're exclusively using ENUM parameters from our data (location, company, major and so forth.)
3. You are comfortable writing SQL queries.

## Can I use wildcards in my search query?

Yes, wildcard terms are supported. However, we have a hard limit of 20 wildcards per query. See the relevant sections for more information about the limitations in [Elasticsearch](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#elasticsearch-query-limitations) and [SQL](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api#sql-query-limitations) search queries.

## Why is there a 1MB limit on the API requests and the response body?

The error message that you are receiving has occurred because the query is too large and cURL can't handle the response. Calling the API with Python should alleviate this issue as Python compresses the extra space within an Elasticsearch query. Additional ways to decrease the query size are to reduce the profile count parameter from `100` to `60` for each call and to remove the `pretty` tag. You can get around this limitation by [Using POST Requests](/docs/examples-person-search-api#using-post-requests).

## Can I exclude PDL IDs in a Person Search call to avoid spending duplicate credits?

You can technically exclude up to 1,000 PDL IDs in a single search query, however you will eventually run into limitations due to our infrastructure. While the PDL ID is mostly persistent, it's possible that the IDs can get merged, deleted, or opted out from our dataset across releases. Additionally, we will truncate extremely long queries in our internal logs, making it more difficult to assist you should you need technical support. At some point in the future, we will place limitations on query length and/or performance time to avoid these costly queries.

## Will I be charged for retrieving the same profile multiple times?

Yes. PDL will charge for the retrieval of the same profile.

Example 1  
You search for Engineers in California then conduct another search for Engineers in San Francisco. You will be charged for the overlap in the second request.

Example 2  
You search for Engineers in California and search again for Engineers in California. You will be charged the same amount for each request.

Example 1 is a bit more difficult to handle for programmatically and likely needs a UI/UX approach to limit overlapping queries.

To handle for situations demonstrated in Example 2, PDL recommends duplicate call detection. You can use methods like unique key constraints. For example, you can hash the request, storing the hash, and checking for a duplicate call before sending it to the API to avoid the second situation above.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/quickstart-company-search-api

## Getting Started

In order to use our Company Search API, you must have an active API key. You can look up your API key by logging into our [self-serve dashboard](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/main/api-keys) and going to the **API Keys** section.

> 👍
>
> ### Need an API Key?
>
> If you don't have an API key, you can easily create one by [signing up](https://peopledatalabs.com/signup) for a self-serve account. For more information, check out our [Self-Serve Quickstart Guide](https://blog.peopledatalabs.com/post/self-signup-api-quickstart), which walks you through the sign-up process as well as shows you how to use the self-serve API dashboard.

## Simple Example

As mentioned in the [Overview](/docs/company-search-api#overview), the Company Search API is a means of filtering and segmenting profiles included in our [Company](/docs/company-schema) Dataset. In order to use the Company Search API, **you will need to use either an[Elasticsearch](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#query) query or a [SQL](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#sql) query**.

Here's a quick example to search for company profiles whose `website` is `peopledatalabs.com`:

> ❗️
>
> ### Heads Up! Credit Usage
>
> Company Search API calls cost the number of **total search results** returned.
>
> If you are making a search that could have a large number of results, make sure to use the [`size` parameter](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#size) to set the maximum number of results and cap your credit usage.

# The People Data Labs JavaScript Helper Library

The People Data Labs JavaScript Helper Library makes it easy to interact with our APIs from your JavaScript application. You can find the [most recent version of the library on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/peopledatalabs).

## How To Install the Library

This library is available as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/peopledatalabs) package, and you can install it like this:

NPMYarn

```
npm i -S peopledatalabs
```

```
yarn add peopledatalabs
```

## Using the Library

Make sure that you sign up for a [free PDL API key](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/signup) if you don't already have one.

JavaScript

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY });

// Chaining Implementation
PDLClient.person.enrichment({ profile: 'linkedin.com/in/seanthorne' }).then((response) => {
  // Print the API response in JSON format
  console.log(response?.data);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});

// Async/Await Implementation
try {
  const getPersonRecord = async () => {
    const response = await PDLClient.person.enrichment({ profile: 'linkedin.com/in/seanthorne' });
    // Print the API response in JSON format
    console.log(response?.data);
  }
  
  getPersonRecord();
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

## TypeScript Support

The People Data Labs JavaScript Helper Library ships with TypeScript types. You can use these to gain the benefits of using TypeScript without having to write your own types.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/output-response-person-identify-api

## Response Data Structure

The response from the Person Identify API will be in this format:

JSON

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "matches": [
    {
      "data": {
        ...
      },
      "match_score": 92,
      "matched_on": [
        "company",
        "name"
      ]
    },
    {
      "data": {
        ...
      },
      "match_score": 5,
      "matched_on": [
        "name"
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Response Fields

### `status`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The [API response code](/docs/errors). |

  

### `matches`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Array (Object)` | A list of up to 20 profiles matching the input criteria from the API request. Only returns profiles with a [`match_score`](#matchesmatch_score) greater than 5. |

Each object returned in the matches array will have the following attributes:

  

### `matches.match_score`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | How likely that this record is the record you're looking for based on your query. Will be between `1-99`. |

`match_score` measures how strongly a profile matches the input search criteria. The score is used to rank matching profiles and filter out profiles below a given score (default 5).

The more specific the input criteria is, the more useful the match\_score becomes. For example, if you wanted to find "John Smith", there would be too many possible matches. However, if you searched for "John Smith in New York City with the email address \_\_\_", it is much more likely that the profile with the highest `match_score` is the person you're looking for.

  

### `matches.data`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Object` | The full [person profile](/docs/fields) of the match. |

  

### `matches.matched_on`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Array (String)` | Which fields in the input query match the results in the returned profile.   * \*IMPORTANT:\*\* This field will only be included in the response if the [`include_if_matched` flag](/docs/input-parameters-person-identify-api#include_if_matched) is set to `true`. |

See the [`include_if_matched` input parameter](/docs/input-parameters-person-identify-api#include_if_matched) for more details.

  

## Errors

Any request that does not return a `200` success response will instead use the format described in [Errors](/docs/errors).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/data-delivery-using-s3

Our preferred mode of delivery is through Amazon's AWS S3 service.

To set up this delivery, do the following:

1. Sign into the AWS S3 console.
2. Create a bucket for deliveries (for example, `s3://YOURCOMPANY-data-deliveries`).
   1. If you are using an existing bucket, ensure that [Requester Pays](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RequesterPaysExamples.html) is disabled.
3. Modify the bucket policy in the **Permissions** tab.
4. Paste the following into your permissions and replace `{{your bucket name}}` with your new bucket name (for example, `YOURCOMPANY-data-deliveries`) and click **Save**.

JSON

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "People Data Labs Bucket Permissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::556708831556:role/pdl-customer-deliveries"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                "s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock",
                "s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::{{your bucket name}}",
                "arn:aws:s3:::{{your bucket name}}/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Email [success@peopledatalabs.com](mailto:success@peopledatalabs.com?Subject=S3%20YOURCOMPANY) with your bucket URL.

### Note on S3 Saving

When you click **Save** on the **Bucket Policy** page, AWS may **not** provide a **"Saved"** notification message and may also display the following:

This is a standard AWS message but for some it can be confusing. To confirm the new policy above is saved, refresh the page and check if the policy is still there.

### Note on Data Delivery & IAM

Per best practices, we do **not** support the use of IAM users for data delivery. IAM users utilize Access Keys / Secret Access Keys and would need to be rotated regularly. The best practice is to use **roles** with the policy described above, which allows our PDL role to deliver the data to you.

## Using the Library

Make sure that you sign up for a [free PDL API key](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/signup) if you don't already have one.

Rust

```
let api_key = std::env::var("PDL_API_KEY").unwrap();
let client = PDL::new(&api_key);

let mut person_params = PersonParams::default();
person_params.profile = Some(vec!["linkedin.com/in/seanthorne".to_string()]);

let mut enrich_params = EnrichPersonParams::default();
enrich_params.person_params = person_params.clone();

let results = client.person.enrich(enrich_params);

println!("{:#?}", results);
```

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/preview-search-api

## Overview

The Preview Search API supports our [Person Search API](/docs/person-search-api) by providing a preview of which fields have data in each record matching a search query.

## Request Format

The endpoint for the Preview Search API is `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/search`.

> 📘
>
> ### Creating an API Key for Preview Search
>
> The Preview Search API uses **the same endpoint** as the [Person Search API](/docs/person-search-api). Your [API Key](/docs/quickstart#create-an-account) will determine whether you use the Person Search or Preview Search API.
>
> To create an API Key that supports the Person Search Preview API, speak with your [data consultant](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/talk-to-sales).

See [Input Parameters - Person Search API](/docs/input-parameters-person-search-api) for details on the supported parameters. All valid input parameters for the Person Search API will work the same way for the Preview Search API.

### Example

Python3 (Elasticsearch)Python3 (SQL)cURL

```
import requests, json

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "YOUR PREVIEW SEARCH ENABLED API KEY"

# Set the Preview Search API URL
PDL_URL = "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/search"

# Set the headers
HEADERS = {
    "X-Api-Key": API_KEY
}

# Create an Elasticsearch query
ES_QUERY = {
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {"term": {"job_company_name": "people data labs"}}
      ]
    }
  }
}

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
  'query': json.dumps(ES_QUERY),
  'size': 10,
  'pretty': True
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
json_response = requests.get(PDL_URL, headers=HEADERS, params=PARAMS).json()

# Check for successful response
if json_response["status"] == 200:
  record = json_response['data']

  # Save preview data to JSON file
  with open("my_pdl_search_preview.jsonl", "w") as out:
    out.write(json.dumps(record) + "\n")
else:
  print("Search preview unsuccessful. See error and try again.")
  print("error:", json_response)
```

```
import requests, json

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "YOUR PREVIEW SEARCH ENABLED API KEY"

# Set the Preview Search API URL
PDL_URL = "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/search"

# Set the headers
HEADERS = {
    "X-Api-Key": API_KEY
}

# Create a SQL query
SQL_QUERY = \
"""
  SELECT * FROM person
  WHERE job_company_name='people data labs';
"""

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
  'query': SQL_QUERY,
  'size': 10,
  'pretty': True
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Person Enrichment API
json_response = requests.get(PDL_URL, headers=HEADERS, params=PARAMS).json()

# Check for successful response
if json_response["status"] == 200:
  record = json_response['data']

  # Save preview data to JSON file
  with open("my_pdl_search_preview.jsonl", "w") as out:
    out.write(json.dumps(record) + "\n")
else:
  print("Search preview unsuccessful. See error and try again.")
  print("error:", json_response)
```

```
# Elasticsearch
curl -X GET 'https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/search' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: xxxx' \
--data-raw '{
  "size": 10,
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {"term": {"job_company_name": "people data labs"}}
      ]
    }
  }
}'

# SQL
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/search' \
  -H 'X-Api-Key: xxxx' \
  --data-raw '{
    "size": 10,
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM person WHERE job_company_name='\''people data labs'\'';"
}'
```

## Response Format

The Preview Search API is a wrapper on the Person Search API, meaning it returns all of [the same fields](/docs/fields) as the Person Search API, but with **true / false** values instead (**true** meaning we have a value for that field and **false** meaning we do not have a value for it).

Any nested objects will not be included in the Preview Search response. For example, if a record has data for the `education` field, the response will have `"education": true`, but will not list any of the subfields (such as `education.major`).

To help users know which record they're looking at, the following fields will have the actual data if it exists for the record: `id`, `full_name`, `sex`, `linkedin_url`, `industry`, `job_title`, `job_title_levels`, `job_company_name`, `job_company_website`, `location_name`. All other fields will have true/false values as described above.

The output is formatted as such:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `Integer` | The HTTP status code. |
| `data` | `Array (Object)` | The person response objects that match the input query. |
| `scroll_token` | `String` | The scroll token to use to fetch the next batch of results for the query. |
| `total` | `Integer` | The total number of search results matching the input query. |

### Field Availability

The Preview Search API will only return the fields shown in the example response above. Even if you have purchased additional fields or bundles for Person Search, those fields will not show in the Preview Search response.

### Errors

If the request encounters an error, it will instead return an Error Response in the format described in [Errors](/docs/errors).

## Access & Billing

The Preview Search API is available for purchase by enterprise API customers. If you’d like access, please [reach out to us](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/talk-to-sales).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/quickstart-company-enrichment-api

## Getting Started

In order to use our Company Enrichment API, you must have an active API key. You can look up your API key by logging into our [self-serve dashboard](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/main/api-keys) and going to the **API Keys** section.

> 👍
>
> ### Need an API Key?
>
> If you don't have an API key, you can easily create one by [signing up](https://peopledatalabs.com/signup) for a self-serve account. For more information, check out our [Self-Serve Quickstart Guide](https://blog.peopledatalabs.com/post/self-signup-api-quickstart), which walks you through the sign-up process as well as shows you how to use the self-serve API dashboard.

## Simple Example

As mentioned in the [Overview](/docs/company-enrichment-api#overview), the Company Enrichment API is a means of performing a one-to-one match of a company with those included in our [Company](/docs/company-schema) Dataset. In order to use the Company Enrichment API, **you will need one of the[input parameters](/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api) of the API**.

Here's a quick example that demonstrates retrieving a record with a `website` of `google.com`:

Python3 SDKcURLJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
)

# Create a parameters JSON object
QUERY_STRING = {"website":"google.com"}

# Pass the parameters object to the Company Enrichment API
response = CLIENT.company.enrichment(**QUERY_STRING)

# Print the API response
print(response.text)
```

```
curl -X GET -G \
  'https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/enrich'\
  -H 'X-Api-Key: xxxx'\
  --data-urlencode 'website=google.com'
```

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLJSClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: "YOUR API KEY" });

// Create a parameters JSON object
const queryString = {"website":"google.com"}

// Pass the parameters object to the Company Enrichment API
PDLJSClient.company.enrichment(queryString).then((response) => {
    // Print the API response
    console.log(response);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});
```

```
# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-ruby
require 'peopledatalabs'

# Set your API key
Peopledatalabs.api_key = 'YOUR API KEY'

# Create a parameters JSON object
QUERY_STRING = {"website":"google.com"}

# Pass the parameters object to the Company Enrichment API
response = Peopledatalabs::Enrichment.company(params: QUERY_STRING)

# Print the API response
puts response
```

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "context"
)

// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go
import (
    pdl "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go"
    pdlmodel "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go/model"
)

func main() {
    // Set your API key
    apiKey := "YOUR API KEY"
    // Set API key as environmental variable
    // apiKey := os.Getenv("API_KEY")

    // Create a client, specifying your API key
    client := pdl.New(apiKey)
    
    // Create a parameters JSON object
    queryString := pdlmodel.CompanyParams{Website: "google.com"}
    
    params := pdlmodel.EnrichCompanyParams{
        CompanyParams: queryString,
    }
    
    // Pass the parameters object to the Company Enrichment API
    response, err := client.Company.Enrich(context.Background(), params)
    
    // Check for successful response
    if err == nil {
        // Print the API response
        fmt.Println(response)
    }  
}
```

```
import requests

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY"

# Set the Company Enrichment API URL
PDL_URL = "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/enrich"

# Create a parameters JSON object
QUERY_STRING = {"website":"google.com"}

# Set headers
HEADERS = {
    'accept': "application/json",
    'content-type': "application/json",
    'x-api-key': API_KEY
    }

# Pass the parameters object to the Company Enrichment API
response = requests.request("GET", PDL_URL, headers=HEADERS, params=QUERY_STRING)

# Print the API response
print(response.text)
```

The API will return the matching company record if the website matches one in our dataset.

The result of running the above code should be the profile for Google from our [Company Dataset](/docs/company-stats). To see a full company profile that would be returned, check out our [Example Company Record](/docs/example-company-record).

JSON

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "name": "google",

  ...
  "likelihood": 4
}
```

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/quickstart-cleaner-apis

## Getting Started

In order to use one of our Cleaner APIs, you must have an active API key. You can look up your API key by logging into our [self-serve dashboard](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/main/api-keys) and going to the **API Keys** section.

> 👍
>
> ### Need an API Key?
>
> If you don't have an API key, you can easily create one by [signing up](https://peopledatalabs.com/signup) for a self-serve account. For more information, check out our [Self-Serve Quickstart Guide](https://blog.peopledatalabs.com/post/self-signup-api-quickstart), which walks you through the sign-up process as well as shows you how to use the self-serve API dashboard.

## Simple Example

As mentioned in the [Overview](/docs/cleaner-apis#overview), the Cleaner APIs are a means of cleaning company, school and location data in order to get the best results from your API queries. To use the Cleaner APIs, **you will need a set of[input parameters](/docs/input-parameters-cleaner-apis) for the particular Cleaner API that you are using**.

Here's a quick example that demonstrates cleaning a company record with a `website` of `peopledatalabs.com`:

Python3 SDKJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
)

# Create a parameters JSON object
QUERY_STRING = {"website":"peopledatalabs.com"}

# Pass the parameters object to the Company Cleaner API
response = CLIENT.company.cleaner(**QUERY_STRING)

# Print the API response
print(response.text)
```

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLJSClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: "YOUR API KEY" });

// Create a parameters JSON object
const queryString = {
  website: "peopledatalabs.com"
}

// Pass the parameters object to the Company Cleaner API
PDLJSClient.company.cleaner(queryString).then((response) => {
  // Print the API response
  console.log(response);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
```

```
# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-ruby
require 'peopledatalabs'

# Set your API key
Peopledatalabs.api_key = 'YOUR API KEY'

# Pass parameters to the Company Cleaner API
response = Peopledatalabs::Cleaner.company(kind: 'website', value: "peopledatalabs.com")

# Print the API response
puts response
```

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "context"
)

// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go
import (
    pdl "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go"
    pdlmodel "github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-go/model"
)

func main() {
    // Set your API key
    apiKey := "YOUR API KEY"
    // Set API key as environmental variable
    // apiKey := os.Getenv("API_KEY")

    // Create a client, specifying your API key
    client := pdl.New(apiKey)
    
    // Create a parameters JSON object
    queryString := pdlmodel.CleanCompanyParams{Website: "peopledatalabs.com"}

    // Pass the parameters object to the Company Cleaner API
    response, err := client.Company.Clean(context.Background(), queryString)
  
    // Check for successful response
    if err == nil {
        // Print the API response
        fmt.Println(response)
    }  
}
```

```
import requests

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY"

# Set the Company Cleaner API URL
PDL_URL = "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/clean"

# Create a parameters JSON object
QUERY_STRING = {"website":"peopledatalabs.com"}

# Set headers
HEADERS = {
    'accept': "application/json",
    'content-type': "application/json",
    'x-api-key': API_KEY
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Company Cleaner API
response = requests.request("GET", PDL_URL, headers=HEADERS, params=QUERY_STRING)

# Print the API response
print(response.text)
```

The response that the API returns is a cleaned company profile if the input parameters passed to it matches a record in our company dataset:

JSON

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "name": "people data labs",
  "size": "11-50",

## Simple Example

Let's say that you are interested in getting all schools that begin with "harv." The Autocomplete API is the perfect tool for doing this, as it allows you to find multiple schools using a small set of input characteristics.

The [list of supported inputs](/docs/input-parameters-autocomplete-api) includes the field that you're seeking and the text that you want to complete. In this example, we'll use the following parameters:

**Input Parameters**

| Parameter Name | Parameter Value |
| --- | --- |
| [`field`](/docs/input-parameters-autocomplete-api#field) | `school` |
| [`text`](/docs/input-parameters-autocomplete-api#text) | `harv` |
| [`size`](/docs/input-parameters-autocomplete-api#size) | `10` |
| [`titlecase`](/docs/input-parameters-autocomplete-api#titlecase) | `True` |
| [`pretty`](/docs/input-parameters-autocomplete-api#pretty) | `True` |

Using this information, you can now query the Autocomplete API to find schools beginning with "harv":

Python3 SDKcURLJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
import json

# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
)

# Create a parameters JSON object
PARAMS = {
    "field": "school",
    "text": "harv",
    "size": 10,
    "titlecase": True,
    "pretty": True
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Autocomplete API
json_response = CLIENT.autocomplete(**PARAMS).json()

# Print the API response in JSON format
print(json_response)
```

```

    // Print the API response in JSON format
    console.log(data);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});
```

}

# Pass the parameters object to the Autocomplete API
json_response = requests.get(PDL_URL, params=PARAMS).json()

# Print the API response in JSON format
print(json_response)
```

The response that the API returns is as follows:

  "data": [

## Response Fields

### `fields`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Array (String)` | The list of fields in the [Person Schema](/docs/fields) that the Autocomplete API has returned suggestions for. It determines these based on the value that you used for the [`field` input parameter](/docs/input-parameters-autocomplete-api#field). |

See the [`field` input parameter description](/docs/input-parameters-autocomplete-api#field) for the mapping between Autocomplete API fields and Person Schema fields.

  

### `data`

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/quickstart-person-identify-api

## Getting Started

In order to use the Person Identify API, you must have an active API key. You can look up your API key by logging into our [self-serve dashboard](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/main/api-keys) and going to the API Keys section.

> 👍
>
> ### Need an API Key?
>
> If you don't have an API key, you can easily create one by [signing up](https://peopledatalabs.com/signup) for a self-serve account. Check out our [Self-Serve Quickstart Guide](https://blog.peopledatalabs.com/post/self-signup-api-quickstart), which walks you through the sign up process as well as how to use the self-serve API dashboard.

## Simple Example

Let's say that you want to find all the profiles associated with the CEO of People Data Labs, Sean Thorne. The Person Identify API is the perfect tool for doing this, as it allows you to find multiple profiles using a set of input characteristics, similar to our [Person Enrichment API](/docs/enrichment-api).

The [list of supported inputs](/docs/identify-api-input-parameters) includes names, email addresses, company information, profiles and much more. In this case, we'll assume all we have is Sean's name and his company's name:

**Input Parameters**

| Parameter Name | Parameter Value |
| --- | --- |
| [`first_name`](/docs/identify-api-input-parameters#first_name) | `sean` |
| [`last_name`](/docs/identify-api-input-parameters#last_name) | `thorne` |
| [`company`](/docs/identify-api-input-parameters#company) | `people data labs` |
| [`pretty`](/docs/identify-api-input-parameters#pretty) | `True` |

Using this information, you can now query the Person Identify API to find the profiles associated with Sean:

Python3 SDKcURLJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

Each object in the `matches` array contains a unique profile from our Person Dataset as well as a [`match_score`](/docs/identify-api-output-response#matchesmatch_score), which the API uses to sort the profiles in the `matches` array. You can use this profile data for various purposes. Typically, our users tend to fuse this with additional data to build more comprehensive identities.

## Company Cleaner API Example Using POST

*"Show me how this company is stored in PDL based on the name using a POST request."*

> 📘
>
> ### Difference Between GET and POST Requests
>
> See this article for a comparison of the [differences between GET and POST requests](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp). The biggest difference is that POST requests don't have any limit on the amount of data that you can pass in a request.

Python3cURL

```
import requests

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY"

# Set the School Cleaner API URL
PDL_URL = "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/clean"

# Create a parameters JSON object

# Set headers
HEADERS = {
    'accept': "application/json",
    'content-type': "application/json",
    'x-api-key': API_KEY
}

# Pass the parameters object to the Company Cleaner API using POST method
response = requests.post(
  PDL_URL,
  headers=HEADERS,
  json=QUERY_STRING # Passing the data directly as a JSON object
).json()

# Print the API response
print(response)
```

```
curl -X POST \

# Examples

We've provided code samples in Python, cURL, Ruby, Go and JavaScript. If you aren't comfortable working in any of these languages, feel free to use this [handy tool](https://curl.trillworks.com/) to convert code from cURL to the language of your choice.

> ❗️
>
> ### Heads Up! Credit Usage
>
> Company Search API calls cost the number of **total search results** returned.
>
> If you are making a search that could have a large number of results, make sure to use the [`size` parameter](/docs/input-parameters-company-search-api#size) to set the maximum number of results and cap your credit usage.

> 💡
>
> ### We want your feedback!
>
> Do you see a bug? Is there an example you'd like to see that's not listed here?
>
> Head over to the public roadmap and submit a [bug ticket](https://peopledatalabs.canny.io/bugs) or a [feature request](https://peopledatalabs.canny.io/feature-requests) and receive automatic notifications as your bug is resolved or your request is implemented.

## Using POST Requests

*"I would like to use POST requests to query instead of GET requests so that I can make queries with a lot of parameters."*

> 📘
>
> ### Difference Between GET and POST Requests
>
> See this article for a comparison of the [differences between GET and POST requests](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp). The biggest difference is that POST requests don't have any limit on the amount of data that you can pass in a request.

## Bulk Retrieval

*"I want to find**all** automotive companies in the Detroit area and save them to a CSV file."*

> 🚧
>
> ### High Credit Usage Code Below
>
> The code example below illustrates retrieving all the company profiles in a metro area and is meant primarily for demonstrating the use of the `scroll_token` parameter when requesting large amounts of records. As a result, this code is mostly illustrative in meaning. It further can expend a lot of credits and doesn't have any error handling. The `MAX_NUM_RECORDS_LIMIT` parameter in the example sets the maximum number of profiles that you will retrieve (and the maximum number of credits that you will expend), so please set that accordingly when testing this example.

# Examples

When specifying query parameters within a URL, you should separate them with an ampersand (`&`). When specifying query parameters within a JSON object, you should use lists for the request parameters.

We've provided code samples in cURL, Python, Ruby, Go and JavaScript. If you aren't comfortable working in any of these languages, feel free to use this [handy tool](https://curl.trillworks.com/) to convert code from cURL to the language of your choice.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/bulk-company-enrichment-api

## Overview

The Bulk Company Enrichment API provides a way to enrich multiple profiles using the [Company Enrichment API](/docs/company-enrichment-api) in one request.

> 📘
>
> ### Bulk Enrichment vs Company Search
>
> The Bulk Enrichment API is **NOT** the same as the [Company Search API](/docs/company-search-api).
>
> The Bulk Enrichment API is the same as calling the [Company Enrichment API](/docs/company-enrichment-api) multiple times.
>
> Use the Bulk Enrichment API when you want to get detailed profiles for a set of companies you already know (such as getting the funding details of each company in a list). Use the Company Search API to find an undetermined number of companies that match your search criteria (such as finding fast-growing companies in a certain industry).

## Access & Billing

Any customer that has Company Enrich credits can use the Bulk Company Enrichment API.

We will deduct the number of remaining Company Enrichment credits in your account by the number of `200` status responses in a Bulk Enrichment request as though you made each request individually.

## Request Format

The endpoint for the bulk enrichment api is `POST https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/enrich/bulk`.

You can enrich up to 100 companies in a single request.

The request body must contain an array called `requests` with 1-100 individual request objects, each containing a `params` object for each request's parameters. See [Input Parameters - Company Enrichment API](/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api) for details on the supported Enrichment API parameters.

| Field Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requests` | All requests to make in the bulk enrichment. | `Array [Object]` |
| `params` | The parameters for a single enrichment call. | `Object` |

JSON

```
{
  "requests": [
    {
      "params": {
        ...
      }
    },
    {
      "params": {
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Example

Python3cURL

```
import requests
import json

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY"

# Pass your API key in header
HEADERS = {
    'X-Api-Key': API_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}

# Create an array of parameters JSON objects
DATA = {
    "requests": [
        {
            "params": {
                "profile": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/walmart"
            }
        },
        {
            "params": {
                "website": "google.com"
            }
        }
    ]
}

# Pass the bulk parameters object to the Bulk Company Enrichment API using POST method
try:
    response = requests.post(
        'https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/enrich/bulk',
        headers=HEADERS,
        json=DATA
    )

    # Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parse the JSON response
        json_responses = response.json()

        # Iterate through the array of API responses
        for response_data in json_responses:

            # Check for successful response
            if response_data["status"] == 200:

                # Print selected fields
                print(
                    response_data['size'],
                    response_data['employee_count'],
                    response_data['industry'],
                    response_data['location']
                )
                print(f"Successfully enriched profile with PDL data.")

                # Save enrichment data to JSON file (append mode)
                with open(f"my_pdl_enrichment.{response_data['linkedin_slug']}.jsonl", "a") as out:
                    out.write(json.dumps(response_data) + "\n")
            else:
                print("Enrichment unsuccessful. See error and try again.")
                print("error:", response_data)
    else:
        print(f"Request failed with status code {response.status_code}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during the request: {e}")
```

```
curl -X POST "https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/company/enrich/bulk" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: XXXX' \
-d ' {
    "requests": [
        {
            "params": {
                "profile": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/walmart"
            }
        },
            {
            "params": {
                "website": "google.com"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

## Response Format

Bulk Enrichment responses are a **JSON Array** of objects with the following fields:

| Field Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data` | The person response object. | `Object` |
| `status` | The HTTP status code. | `Integer` |
| `likelihood` | The likelihood score. | `Integer` |

JSON

```
[
	{"status": 200, "likelihood": 10, "data": ...},
	{"status": 200, "likelihood": 10, "data": ...}
]
```

The order the objects appear in the response list is the same as the order of the `params` in the input `requests` array.

Each response contains an individual status code that shows whether the enrichment for that particular request was successful (`200`) or not. See [Errors](/docs/errors) for a detailed breakdown on all possible status codes.

### Errors

If the request encounters an error, it will instead return an Error Response in the format described in [Errors](/docs/errors).

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/quickstart-job-title-enrichment-api

## Getting Started

In order to use our Job Title Enrichment API, you must have an enterprise account. Contact us at [support@peopledatalabs.com](mailto:support@peopledatalabs.com) to learn more.

## Simple Example

As mentioned in the [Overview](/docs/job-title-enrichment-api#overview), the Job Title Enrichment API is a means of performing a one-to-one match of a job title with those included in our [Job Title](/docs/job-title-schema) Dataset. In order to use the Job Title Enrichment API, **you will need the[job title](/docs/input-parameters-job-title-enrichment-api#job_title) that you want to look up**.

Here's a quick example that demonstrates retrieving a record with a `job_title` of `supply manager`:

Python3 SDKcURLJavaScriptRubyGoPython3

```
# See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-python
from peopledatalabs import PDLPY

# Create a client, specifying your API key
CLIENT = PDLPY(
    api_key="YOUR API KEY",
)

# Create a parameters JSON object
QUERY_STRING = {"job_title": "supply manager"}

# Pass the parameters object to the Job Title Enrichment API
response = CLIENT.job_title(**QUERY_STRING)

# Print the API response
print(response.text)
```

```
curl -X GET -G \
  'https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/job_title/enrich' \
  -H 'X-Api-Key: YOUR API KEY' \
  --data-urlencode 'job_title=supply manager'
```

```
// See https://github.com/peopledatalabs/peopledatalabs-js
import PDLJS from 'peopledatalabs';

// Create a client, specifying your API key
const PDLJSClient = new PDLJS({ apiKey: "YOUR API KEY" });

// Create a parameters JSON object
const queryString = {jobTitle: "supply manager"}

// Pass the parameters object to the Job Title API
PDLJSClient.jobTitle(queryString).then((data) => {
    // Print the API response
    console.log(data);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});

The API returns a record like the one below if the `job_title` that you passed it exists in our dataset:

JSON

```
{
  "cleaned_job_title": "supply manager",
  "similar_job_titles": [
    "senior supply manager",

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/react-component-for-autocomplete

## What is the React Component for Autocomplete?

The React Component for Autocomplete lets you use the Autocomplete API to find valid Search API query values for a specific field (along with the number of available records for each suggestion.)

## How Does the Component Work?

The component works by letting users get autocomplete suggestions in a dropdown list. Using this list, they then can make a suggestion that gets passed to a callback function. For example, when a user queries the `company` field for `goog,` the component will display a dropdown list that includes suggestions that most closely matches this search, such as `google`. Then, when the user makes a selection, this gets sent as an argument to a callback function that has been passed to the component as a prop.

## How To Install the Component

This component is available as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdl-react-autocomplete) package, and you can install it like this:

NPMYarn

```
npm i -S pdl-react-autocomplete
```

```
yarn add pdl-react-autocomplete
```

## Using the Component

Make sure that you sign up for a [free PDL API key](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/signup) if you don't already have one.

JavaScript

```
import Autocomplete from 'pdl-react-autocomplete';

return (
  <div className="App">
  	<Autocomplete
      field={'company'}
      size={5}
      onTermSelected={(term) => console.log('onSelectedTerm', term)}
      apiKey={'insertKeyHere'}
		/>
	</div>
);
```

> 🚧
>
> ### Security Disclaimer
>
> You should use this library as an internal tool or as a proof of concept, as it fires off requests to the Autocomplete API from the client. This is due to the nature of React components and that API keys are all-encompassing at PDL. We highly suggest referencing the component's codebase for spinning up your own version but accessing the Autocomplete API through a proxy server and not using this in a public production environment.

## More Information, Pull Requests, Feature Suggestions and Bug Reports

## Endpoint

The endpoint for the Job Title Enrichment API is `v5/job_title/enrich`.

## Billing and Access

This API is currently in production, and you can access it by using your API key.

The HTTP response code will be `200` when the API returns a matching job title and `404` when the API neither finds nor returns a matching job title. We charge per match.

## Rate Limiting

Our default limit for free customers is 100 per minute. Our default limit for paying customers is 5,000 per minute.

## Input Parameters

> 📘
>
> ### For More Details, See [Job Title Enrichment API - Input Parameters](/docs/input-parameters-job-title-enrichment-api)
>
> You can also click on the individual parameter names in the table below to view more information on them.

| Parameter Name | Required | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`job_title`](/docs/input-parameters-job-title-enrichment-api#job_title) | Yes | The job title that you are enriching. | None | `pastry chef` |
| [`api_key`](/docs/input-parameters-job-title-enrichment-api#api_key) | No\* | Your secret API key.  While we do not require this as part of the request parameters, if you do not provide it here, then you must provide it using an alternative means, such as in the headers using the `x-api-key` field. For more information, see the [Authentication](/docs/authentication) page. | None |  |
| [`pretty`](/docs/input-parameters-job-title-enrichment-api#pretty) | No | Whether the output should have human-readable indentation. | `false` | `true` |
| [`titlecase`](/docs/input-parameters-job-title-enrichment-api#titlecase) | No | All text in the API responses returns as lowercase by default. Setting `titlecase` to `true` will titlecase the text in `200` responses. | `false` | `true` |

## Response Data Structure

Here is an example response from the Company Enrichment API:

JSON

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "name": "people data labs",
  "id": "tnHcNHbCv8MKeLh92946LAkX6PKg",
  ...,
  "likelihood": 6
}
```

See [Example Company Record](/docs/example-company-record) for a full example of the fields included in the response object.

## Response Fields

### `*`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `any` | The matched company profile in the format described in our [Company Schema](/docs/company-schema). |

The [PDL profile](/docs/company-schema) for the company that matches the Enrichment API request. Any profile field that we do not have data for will have a `null` value.

Unlike our other APIs, the profile fields for the Company Enrichment API are **NOT** contained in a top-level `data` object.

  

### `status`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | The [API response code](/docs/errors). |

  

### `likelihood`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Integer` | How confident we are that the returned profile is the same as the company you requested. Will be an integer between `1` and `10`.  You can control the minimum likelihood score that a response must have in order to count as a match by setting the [`min_likelihood` parameter](/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api#min_likelihood) in the API request. |

We assign every match that the API finds during the enrichment process a likelihood score, to represent our confidence that the profile returned is the same as the profile requested. A score of `1` represents a very low confidence level while a score of `10` represents the highest degree of confidence. The likelihood score is logarithmic, so a response that returns a likelihood score of `2` will have roughly a 10-30% chance of being the person requested.

For example, enriching "John Smith, Inc." in "New York" is too vague for us to confidently say which of our profiles is the exact John Smith Inc. that you requested. However, if you were to attach a website, stock ticker, and street address to the request and they matched our data, we would be highly confident that we are returning the correct John Smith Inc.

  

### `matched`

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Array (String)` | Every query input from the request that matched this profile.   * \*IMPORTANT:\*\* This field will only be included in the response if the [`include_if_matched` flag](/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api#include_if_matched) is set to `true`. |

See the [`include_if_matched` input parameter](/docs/input-parameters-company-enrichment-api#include_if_matched) for more details.

# https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/table-flattened-data-license-format

The Table (Flattened) Data License Format is a file format for our Person and Company Data Licenses, that delivers the datasets as flattened tables (in either parquet or CSV format). This file structure is optimized for loading data into relational databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL, simplifying data ingestion and enhancing the speed of delivering new information and insights.

## Schema

* [Person Schema](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qnaivBopVAslTpt8r3QatP2wGi4S9xUz/view?usp=drive_link)
* [Company Schema](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ouqj0XCCHs0RJld1Bcv7g_nKnLg2Aub/view?usp=drive_link)

*Note: Your contracted bundle/s may not include every field/table in the PDF schema above*

## Access

The Tabular Data License Format is available to all data license customers at no additional cost. To request access, contact your Customer Success or Technical Services team.

*Note: Adopting this format means you will receive data in the tabular format going forward. Previous formats will no longer be provided unless specifically requested.*
